<h1>Working group releases consensus recommendations for reducing police-involved deadly force encounters</h1>

	<p class="lede">28 recommendations and 33 action steps cover community healing and engagement, prevention and training, investigations and accountability, policy and legal implications, and officer wellness
</p>
	<p class="lede">Diverse group convened by Attorney General Ellison and Public Safety Commissioner Harrington â only body of its kind in the country â completes six months of public hearings and listening sessions across Minnesota</p>
	
	
	<p><strong>February 24, 2020 (SAINT  PAUL)</strong> â Minnesota Attorney General  Keith Ellison and Commissioner of Public Safety John Harrington today joined  the members of the <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/default.aspx">State  of Minnesota Working Group on Police-Involved Deadly Force Encounters</a> in <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Documents/police-involved-deadly-force-encounters-recommendations.pdf">releasing  28 recommendations and 33 action steps</a> that, if implemented, will reduce  deadly force encounters with law enforcement in Minnesota. The recommendations  fall under the categories of community healing and engagement; prevention and  raining; investigations and accountability; policy and legal implications; and  officer wellness. These are the five pillars of the mandate that the working  set for itself. Its recommendations come after six months of testimony, study,  and deliberation at seven hearings and listening sessions held across  Minnesota, all of which were open to the public.</p>
    <p>The working group, composed  of a <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/working-group-members.aspx">wide  variety</a> of community, advocacy, academic, foundation, mental-health,  law-enforcement, and criminal-justice-system stakeholders, came to consensus on  the recommendations and action steps. It is the only body in the country with  membership this diverse that has taken a holistic, statewide look at the many  factors that contribute to deadly force encounters and their impact on all  people, systems, and communities involved in them, and has made actionable  recommendations for reducing them. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Deadly force encounters are  among the hardest moments a family, an officer, a law-enforcement agency, and a  community can live through. There have been lots of opinions about why they  happen. We wanted to get beyond opinion and polarization to concrete  recommendations and action steps that, if we implement them, will reduce them,&rdquo;  Attorney General Ellison said. &ldquo;We&rsquo;ve gotten there by bringing together a group  of people from diverse backgrounds and experiences who aren&rsquo;t usually invited  to talk to each other about this hard topic and who stuck it out when the going  got tough. And we&rsquo;ve gotten there by doing the work in public and with the  public, especially with family members who lost loved ones in deadly force  encounters.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&quot;These  recommendations, if implemented, will make Minnesota communities and the peace  officers who serve them safer. The recommendations offer practical guidance and  action steps to better prevent and respond to police-involved deadly force  encounters,&quot; Commissioner Harrington said. &quot;We brought together a  knowledgeable group of stakeholders representing diverse backgrounds and  professions from around the state to have the tough conversations. We heard  testimony from 50 experts, including families who lost loved ones. As a result,  we now have a plan of action that will reduce many deadly force encounters with  police and provide justice and support when a tragedy occurs.&quot;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;This is just the beginning.  Now we&rsquo;ll get to work with the Legislature and partners in community, law  enforcement, the criminal-justice system, and beyond to implement these  recommendations and make them work,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison added.</p>
    <p>Reducing police-involved  deadly force encounters is as urgent in Minnesota as it is across the country.  In 2019, 14 community members and one law-enforcement officer died in Minnesota  in deadly force encounters. In addition, a police officer in Waseca who was  gravely wounded in a deadly force encounter in January of this year faces a  long road to recovery. No part of Minnesota is untouched: over the course of  the last five years, 60 percent of the state&rsquo;s more than 100 deadly-force  encounters with law enforcement have taken place in Greater Minnesota.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The executive summary of the  work of the working group, with all 28 recommendations and 33 actions steps, is <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Documents/police-involved-deadly-force-encounters-recommendations.pdf">available  on the Department of Public Safety website</a>. The working group&rsquo;s full report  will be released in 4-6 weeks.</p>
	
    <h2>Recommendations and action  steps</h2>
    <p>The  goal of the working group was to make actionable recommendations to all parties  and communities that, if implemented, will reduce deadly force encounters with  law enforcement. <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Documents/police-involved-deadly-force-encounters-recommendations.pdf">Notable  recommendations among the 28 recommendations and 33 action steps</a> on which  working group members came to consensus include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Establish a  liaison position in the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to ensure that  families of those involved in deadly force encounters are treated with dignity  and respect, kept informed, and referred to services. <em>(1.3)</em></li>
      <li>Establish a  permanent &ldquo;Peacemaker&rdquo; office to work on dispute mediation and resolution,  including after a deadly force encounter; build community capacity to resolve  conflict; promote healing and restoration; and address hate crimes. <em>(1.5)</em></li>
      <li>Adopt a  co-responder model to improve outcomes for people with disabilities or who are  in mental-health crisis, and ensure that officers develop skills to recognize and respond  appropriately to people with disabilities and refer them to appropriate resources. <em>(2.2,  2.7)</em></li>
      <li>Train all  law-enforcement agencies in de-escalation skills and tactics to reduce use of  force, especially when responding to people in crisis. <em>(2.3)</em></li>
      <li>Remove budget  sunset on and expand law-enforcement training funds, and ensure consistency  statewide. <em>(2.5)</em></li>
      <li>Create an  independent, specialized unit within the BCA to investigate all officer-involved shootings and uses  of force that result in death or severe bodily injury. <em>(3.1)</em></li>
      <li>Review law and  policy on body-worn cameras to ensure transparency and accountability in deadly  force encounters; involve community in developing and reviewing policy;  evaluate impact by 2022 and fund statewide implementation if proven effective. <em>(3.3)</em></li>
      <li>Establish  a formal, protected, non-disciplinary Sentinel Event Review to review critical incidents  and identify systemic issues that need to be addressed to improve outcomes. <em>(3.4)</em><strong> </strong></li>
      <li>Adopt  use-of-force standards that make sanctity of life a core organizational value  and include requirements for de-escalation; reasonable, necessary, and  proportionate use of force; duty to intervene; use of sound tactics; reporting  unreasonable use of force <em>(4.2)</em></li>
      <li>Discuss  strategies to increase the role of the Peace Officer Standards and Training  (POST) Board in approving, suspending, or revoking officer licenses at request  of chief or sheriff. <em>(4.3) </em></li>
      <li>Establish  a data-collection and reporting system that tracks all police-involved deadly  force encounters. <em>(4.4)</em></li>
      <li>Pass  carefully crafted privacy protection for protected conversations for  peer-support programs for first responders. <em>(4.7)</em></li>
      <li>Collect, analyze,  and publish data about police-community interactions, use of force, and deadly  force encounters. <em>(4.8)</em></li>
      <li>Expand  resources, and increase statewide awareness of existing resources, to improve  mental health and wellness of first responders and dispatchers. <em>(5.1)</em></li>
    </ul>
    
    <p><a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Documents/police-involved-deadly-force-encounters-recommendations.pdf">All  28 recommendations and 33 actions steps</a> fall within the five pillars of  working group&rsquo;s mandate:</p>
    <ol class="noSpace">
      <li>Community healing  and engagement;</li>
      <li>Prevention and  training;</li>
      <li>Investigations  and accountability;</li>
      <li>Policy and legal  implications;</li>
      <li>Officer wellness.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Working  group members established four criteria for developing recommendations:</p>
    <ol class="noSpace">
      <li>It falls within  the mandate of the working group.</li>
      <li>It is likely to  have an impact on reducing deadly force encounters.</li>
      <li>It is actionable,  with identifiable steps.</li>
      <li>It addresses  community and law-enforcement concerns.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The recommendations and action steps are informed by testimony  from: family members who lost loved ones in deadly force encounters; families  of peace officers involved in deadly force encounters; community members;  local, state, and tribal law enforcement agencies; prosecutors; academics and  researchers; the Minnesota Peace Officer Standards and Training Board; the  Bureau of Criminal Apprehension; mental health and disability advocates;  Minnesota League of Cities; community-healing practitioners; the Minnesota  Chapter of the National Association of Black Law Enforcement Executives; police  union representatives and attorneys; providers of officer mental-health and  wellness programs; other tribal, local, and state representatives; the general  public; and national experts in reducing use of force, policing equity and  data, innovation in prosecution, constitutional law, and community engagement  before, during, and after deadly force encounters.</p>
    <p>The working group did its  work over a period of six months, ending in January. None of the  recommendations should be construed as support for or opposition to any  currently pending legislation. </p>
	
    <h2>Working group background  and process</h2>
    <p>Attorney  General Keith Ellison and Commissioner Harrington began discussing a working  group to identify ways to reduce deadly force encounters with law enforcement  in early 2019, shortly after each took office. On July 22, 2019, they <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/ooc/news-releases/Pages/Working-Group-to-Focus-on-Police-Involved-Deadly-Force-Encounters-in-Minnesota.aspx">announced</a> the <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/default.aspx">State  of Minnesota Working Group on Police-Involved Deadly Force Encounters</a>,  composed of 16 members that they chose to ensure that a cross-section of  community, advocacy, academic, foundation, mental-health, law-enforcement, and  criminal-justice-system stakeholders were at the table. They also chose members  to ensure geographic and racial diversity. In September, Attorney General  Ellison and Commissioner Harrington expanded the working group to 18 members in  direct response to concerns that community expressed that members of the  disability and autism community were not represented. Those <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/working-group-members.aspx">18  members</a> stayed at the table for the duration of the process. </p>
    <p>The working group was  designed for members to listen to and learn from Minnesota-based and national researchers,  experts, advocates, and each other, and especially those most directly involved  in deadly force encounters: families whose loved ones lost their lives in those  encounters; officers themselves, their families, and their agencies; and those  tasked with investigating and prosecuting such cases. </p>
    <p>The working group held four  all-day public hearings and three evening listening sessions around Minnesota  between August 2019 and January 2020: </p>
    <ul class="noSpace">
      <li>August 17, 2019 â  all-day hearing, Saint Paul</li>
      <li>September 28,  2019 â all-day hearing, Mankato</li>
      <li>October 17, 2019  â all-day hearing, Cloquet</li>
      <li>December 5, 2019  â listening session, Minneapolis </li>
      <li>December 17, 2019  â listening session, Bemidji</li>
      <li>December 19, 2019  â listening session, Worthington</li>
      <li>January 6, 2020 â  all-day hearing, Brooklyn Park</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>Each  public hearing day was broadly organized around one of four themes: 1)&nbsp;investigation, oversight, and accountability;  2)&nbsp;prevention, training, and officer wellness; 3)&nbsp;policy and legal  Implications; 4)&nbsp;community healing and mental health. </p>
    <p>The staff and consultant team that helped guide the working  group&rsquo;s deliberations was led by Ron Davis, partner of 21CP Solutions. From  2013â17, Mr. Davis served as director of the Office of Community Oriented  Policing Services of the U.S. Department of Justice. In 2014, President Obama  appointed him to serve as executive director of the <a href="https://www.justice.gov/archives/opa/blog/president-s-task-force-21st-century-policing-recommendations-print-action">President&rsquo;s  Task Force on 21st-Century Policing</a>,  which developed concrete recommendations to improve community trust in police  while enhancing public safety. Mr. Davis is also a former chief of police.</p>
    <h2>Public engagement</h2>
    <p>The public was invited to  speak during the public comment sessions at the conclusion of each hearing and  during the listening sessions, and to submit written testimony to inform the  deliberations of the working group. The Department of Public Safety set up a  web portal at <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/default.aspx">https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/default.aspx</a> to provide the public with full access to <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/hearing-information.aspx">hearings,  agendas, submitted testimony</a> (written and oral), and a mechanism for <a href="https://dps.mn.gov/divisions/co/working-group/Pages/public-testimony.aspx">submitting  public testimony online</a>. All hearing and listening sessions were  live-streamed, videotaped, transcribed, and posted to the website. Meeting  summaries were also prepared and posted for each of the four hearings, and are  provided in the appendix of the executive summary, along with the hearing  agendas.</p>
    <p>Attorney General Ellison and  Commissioner Harrington also held three public listening sessions in December  in Minneapolis, Bemidji, and Worthington.</p>
    <p>In addition, starting in  September, the working group established a session at  the beginning of each all-day hearing that was dedicated to hearing from  families who had lost loved ones in police-involved deadly force encounters, in  direct response to concerns that community and family members raised early on  that those voices were not adequately represented. Attorney General Ellison and  Commissioner Harrington also met privately with family members who lost  loved ones in police-involved deadly force encounters.</p>
