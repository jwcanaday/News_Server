	<p class="lede">First-of-its-kind report sheds light on dysfunction of overly complex pharmaceutical-drug market that doesnât work for people; also outlines main causes of high prices, including abuse of patent and exclusivity laws, anticompetitive practices, and PBMsâ business practices, among others </p>
	
	
	<p><strong>February  19, 2020 (SAINT PAUL)</strong> â After nearly one year of public study and deliberation, Minnesota Attorney  General Ellison&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Initiatives/PharmaceuticalDrugPrices/Taskforce.asp">Advisory Task Force on Lowering  Pharmaceutical Drugs Prices</a> has released a <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report.pdf">report  and 14 recommendations</a> for lowering prescription drug prices that call for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Making  overly complex, opaque, and dysfunctional markets work better for people; </li>
      <li>Using  public power to make drugs more affordable and accessible, especially  life-saving ones; and</li>
      <li>Requiring  more transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical-drug market.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>In clear  language that is designed to be accessible to a wide range of Minnesotans, the  report sheds light on the dysfunctional nature of a highly complex and opaque  pharmaceutical-drug market and the principal factors that contribute to a lack  of transparency about prices and a lack of accountability for driving prices  higher and higher. It also outlines the main factors that contribute to high  prescription-drug prices, including abuse of federal drug patent and  exclusivity laws, a variety of anticompetitive practices â some seemingly  illegal â and the business practices of pharmacy benefit managers, among  others. </p>
    <p>Many prior  studies and reports have focused on how specific segments of the  pharmaceutical-drug market or various individual factors contribute to high  prices. The Attorney General&rsquo;s Task Force report, however, is a first of its  kind in laying out clearly and comprehensively in one place the roles of all  the major players in the pharmaceutical-drug industry; highlighting how each  contributes in various ways to a lack of transparency about and accountability  for high drug prices; and calling out the principal industry practices and  structural factors that lie in the way of making prescription drugs â  especially life-saving ones â more affordable and accessible to the greatest  number of people.</p>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report.pdf">full  report</a> and <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report_ExecSummary.pdf">executive  summary</a>, both of which include the recommendations, are available on  Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s website.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;My job as  Attorney General is to help people afford their lives and live with dignity and  respect. But too many Minnesotans have told me that when it comes to the cost  of their prescription drugs, they&rsquo;re having to choose between affording their  lives and affording to live,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison said. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;I pulled  together this Task Force to change that,&rdquo; he continued. &ldquo;There have been lots  of good ideas out there for lowering drug prices, but they&rsquo;ve been disconnected  from each other. This report, however, uniquely offers a comprehensive, shared  analysis for why we&rsquo;re in the mess we&rsquo;re in and a comprehensive framework for  doing something about it. It uses clear language that every Minnesotan can understand  to shine a bright light on the opaqueness and dysfunction of the  prescription-drug market and call out the factors and practices that drive  prices up and keep them there. If we implement these concrete recommendations,  we will drive drug prices down and help Minnesotans afford their lives.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The report  itself also strikes a big blow for transparency,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison  added. &ldquo;Industry players have for years deliberately hidden who sets drug  prices and how. It&rsquo;s been far too challenging for most people, and even many  experts, to get the full picture of why prices are so high, much less  understand what they can do about it. With this report, no one can say they  don&rsquo;t know. Now, folks now have the knowledge and tools for holding the  industry accountable.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Task  Force co-chair Nicole Smith-Holt said, &ldquo;It has been an honor to serve with so  many people dedicated to finding real solutions to a problem that far too many  Minnesotans are facing. The work the task force has begun has the ability to  impact many lives: if these recommendations are adopted, the people of  Minnesota could see affordable prescription medications which in turn will  assist to save lives. Far too many people do not have the ability to purchase  their medications and far too many people are forced to ration their  medications,&nbsp; which results in long-term health complications and even  death.&rdquo;</p>
	
    <h2>Structure  and analysis of the report</h2>
    <p>The <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report_ExecSummary.pdf">report&rsquo;s  executive summary</a> begins:</p>
    <p style="padding-left:60px;">The  market for prescription drugs in Minnesota and the United States is exceedingly  complex, opaque, rife with anticompetitive and other problematic business  practices, and the laws governing the industry are often misused and abused. In  short, the market for prescription drugs is dysfunctional and the prices of  them are far too high. Significant reforms to how such drugs are regulated,  distributed, and paid for are necessary to rein in the skyrocketing cost of these  often life-saving medications. The goal of this report is to propose solutions  that if properly implemented, will lower the cost of prescription drugs for the  many Minnesotans who struggle to pay for the medications they desperately need.</p>
	<p><a href="../docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report.pdf#page=14"><strong>Section  2</strong></a> of the report  describes how the structure and dynamics of the dysfunctional  pharmaceutical-drug industry, and the complex relationships between its major  players, permit and incentivize high drug prices. A chart produced by Minnesota  Health Action Group that shows in graphic form the complex relationships  between major players in the sales and distribution chains of the  pharmaceutical-drug market, which is on page 20 of the report, is attached to  this release.</p>
	<p><a href="../docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report.pdf#page=36"><strong>Section  3</strong></a> of the report  lays out the major causes and contributors to high prescription-drug prices.  Among these are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>the  misuse and abuse of federal patent and drug-exclusivity laws;</li>
      <li>patients&rsquo;  inability to access more affordable sources of medication through safe  importation channels;</li>
      <li>anticompetitive  conduct in the industry;</li>
      <li>deceptive  and other unlawful marketing practices in the industry;</li>
      <li>the  opacity of and conflicts of interest present in the business models of pharmacy  benefit managers (PBMs); and</li>
      <li>perverse  economic incentives that favor the use of more expensive, branded drugs even  when less expensive generics are available.</li>
    </ol>
    
	<p><a href="../docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report.pdf#page=49"><strong>Section  4</strong></a> of the report  reviews some of the current and past legislative, regulatory, and  law-enforcement efforts across the country to address high prescription-drug  prices. Among those efforts is a drug-price gouging law in Maryland that was  recently found unconstitutional. Legislators and advocates who are working to  pass a drug-price gouging law in Minnesota â which is one of the Task Force&rsquo;s  recommendations â are fashioning a bill that addresses and mitigates that  concern.</p>
    <h2>Recommendations  of the report</h2>
	<p>In <a href="../docs/DPTF_Feb2020Report.pdf#page=53"><strong>Section  5</strong></a> of the report, the Task Force has proposed 14 recommendations that fall  into one or more of three broad categories: 1) making overly complex, opaque,  and dysfunctional markets work better for people; 2) using public power to make  drugs more affordable and accessible, especially life-saving ones; and 3)  requiring more transparency and accountability in the pharmaceutical-drug  market. These recommendations, if and when they are properly implemented, will  bring down the cost of pharmaceutical drugs in Minnesota. </p>
    <p>The  recommendations are:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Create a Prescription Drug Accountability  Commission</strong> to  address drug pricing and related practices in Minnesota. </li>
      <li><strong>Import  four life-saving, critical-access drugs</strong> â insulin, EpiPen, Truvada, and  naxolone â through a prime vendor, and expand the program if successful.</li>
      <li><strong>Enact  drug price-gouging legislation that prohibits drug manufacturers from charging  or causing to be charged an unconscionable price for essential prescription  drugs.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Strengthen  Minnesota&rsquo;s consumer-fraud laws</strong> as they related to deceptive practices in the  pharmaceutical-drug industry.</li>
      <li><strong>Enact  a state anti-kickback law.</strong></li>
      <li><strong>Strengthen Minnesota&rsquo;s antitrust laws</strong> to prohibit specific,  anticompetitive practices present in the drug industry.</li>
      <li><strong>Strongly  advocate for reform of federal drug patent and exclusivity laws</strong> that are being  misused and abused.</li>
      <li><strong>Optimize and expand Minnesota&rsquo;s use of the  federal 340B Drug Pricing Program</strong>, which  allows health care providers to purchase drugs at dramatically reduced prices. </li>
      <li><strong>Quantify how much all Minnesota government  entities spend on prescription drugs</strong>, to enable these entities to better pool and utilize  their bulk-purchasing power. </li>
      <li><strong>Optimize and better utilize Minnesota&rsquo;s  bulk purchasing power</strong> through  MMCAP INFUSE, and extend the discounts it receives to individual Minnesotans.</li>
      <li><strong>Robustly regulate PBMs and their business  practices, building on legislation passed in the 2019 legislative  session.&nbsp; </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Enact additional measures to increase  transparency</strong> into  how drugs are priced and reimbursed throughout the drug sales chain. </li>
      <li><strong>Ensure patient access to pharmacists for  effective medication use. </strong></li>
      <li><strong>Support additional research into  prescription drug pricing and drug benefits.</strong></li>
    </ol>

    <p>&ldquo;These  recommendations are multiple points of attack on a complex, many-sided problem.  While the scope of the problem far exceeds the boundaries of Minnesota, we  can&rsquo;t wait for national action: we can and must take steps to bring prices down  for Minnesotans now,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison said. &ldquo;This report lays out a  comprehensive framework and path for doing just that.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;While  Minnesotans everywhere want drug prices to come down, there are still some  folks who don&rsquo;t. They won&rsquo;t like this report. That&rsquo;s because we&rsquo;re shining a  light on some shady practices â some of them seemingly illegal, some that  should be illegal, some that are legal but immoral â that have kept Big Pharma,  PBMs, and their lobbyists afloat and their profits as sky-high as the prices  Minnesotans pay for their prescription drugs,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison added.  &ldquo;We know they&rsquo;ll attack every step we take because they&rsquo;ve already done it in  every other state that&rsquo;s tried to bring prices down. But when they fight to  keep prices high, businesses practices opaque, and accountability scarce, it  only makes us more determined to do everything in our power to help Minnesotans  afford their lives and afford to live with dignity and respect.&rdquo;</p>

	<h2>Background  on the Task Force</h2>
    <p>Nearly one  year ago to the day, on February 21, 2019, Attorney General Ellison <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/02/21_PrescriptionDrugPricingTaskForce.asp">announced the formation of his  Advisory Task Force on Lowering Pharmaceutical Drug Prices</a>. He stated at the time that his  intent for the Task Force was to gather in the best thinking in order to understand why the prices of  prescription drugs are so high â in some cases, unconscionably high â and come  up with multi-pronged strategies to lower prices. </p>
    <p>On April 4,  2019, Attorney General Ellison <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/04/04_TaskForceMembers.asp">announced the composition of the  15-member Task Force</a>,  which included 10 people chosen through the State&rsquo;s Open Appointments process  out of more than 100 who applied. They are:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Elo Alston,&nbsp;</strong>Patient Advocate </li>
      <li><strong>Jessica Braun,</strong>&nbsp;Nurse Practitioner </li>
      <li><strong>Nazie Eftekhari,</strong>&nbsp;Founder and CEO, HealthEZ </li>
      <li><strong>Phu Huynh,&nbsp;</strong>Pharmacy Manager, NorthPoint Medical  Clinic </li>
      <li><strong>Christy Kuehn,</strong>&nbsp;Patient Advocate </li>
      <li><strong>Shirlynn LaChapelle,</strong>&nbsp;Nurse Consultant </li>
      <li><strong>Rose Roach,</strong>&nbsp;Executive Director, Minnesota Nurses Association </li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Stephen Schondelmeyer,&nbsp;</strong>Professor of  pharmaceutical economics at the University of Minnesota; director, PRIME  Institute, College of Pharmacy, University of Minnesota </li>
      <li><strong>Nicole Smith-Holt,</strong>&nbsp;Charity Ambassador,  T1International </li>
      <li><strong>Dr. Leonard Snellman,</strong>&nbsp;General Pediatrician,  HealthPartners </li>
    </ul>

    <p>The other  five members of the Task Force are legislators from each party in each house â  Senator Scott Jensen (RâChaska), Senator Matt Little (DFLâLakeville),  Representative Rod Hamilton (RâMountain Lake), and Representative John Lesch  (DFLâSaint Paul) â and Dr. Cody Wiberg, executive director of the Minnesota  Board of Pharmacy. Attorney General Ellison served as an <em>ex officio</em> member.</p>
    <p>At the  first meeting of the Task Force on April 23, 2019, members chose Senator Jensen  and Ms. Holt-Smith to co-chair the Task Force. Senator Jensen is a practicing  physician. Ms. Smith-Holt is a national advocate for #Insulin4All. Her  26-year-old son Alex died in 2017 of ketoacidosis after he began rationing his  insulin because he could not afford it.</p>
    <p>Since then,  the full Task Force has met eight times and the Task Force&rsquo;s three working  groups a total of 15 additional times. All meetings have been open to the  public. Task Force members have considered scores of hours of presentations and  testimony and many hundreds of pages of research and reports on the topic, from  a broad mix of perspectives. Information about the Task Force&rsquo;s meetings,  working groups, and testimony and research considered is on <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/02/21_PrescriptionDrugPricingTaskForce.asp">Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s website</a>. </p>
