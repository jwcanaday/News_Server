<h1>Attorney General Ellison and Pharmacy Board announce liquidation of opioid manufacturer Insys</h1>

	<p class="lede"><em>Resolves litigation, disciplinary action that Attorney General and Board of Pharmacy filed against Insys, one of two opioid manufacturers AGO has sued

</em></p>
	<p class="lede"><em>Bipartisan, multistate plan requires public disclosure of Insysâs documents, provides monetary relief to states, local governments, and tribes </em></p>
	
	
	<p align="left"><strong>January 17, 2020 (SAINT PAUL)</strong> â Attorney General Keith Ellison  and the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy announced today that a federal bankruptcy  court has confirmed a bipartisan, multistate plan that liquidates opioid  manufacturer Insys Therapeutics, Inc., one of two manufacturers of highly  addictive opioids that the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has sued. The plan  requires public disclosure of millions of Insys&rsquo;s internal documents related to  its marketing of the opioid Subsys, and provides monetary relief to states,  local governments, and tribes.</p>
    <p align="left">The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and the Minnesota Board  of Pharmacy filed suit against Insys in Hennepin County District Court in May  2018. The Minnesota Board of Pharmacy concurrently brought a separate  disciplinary action before the Office of Administrative Hearings. The lawsuit  and the disciplinary action both detailed Insys&rsquo;s use of troubling sales  tactics â including sales quotas, cash incentives, and &ldquo;speaker&rdquo; payments to  high-volume prescribers â to unlawfully promote a fentanyl opioid product for  unapproved uses and in large doses that endangered Minnesota patients.</p>
    <p align="left">Numerous Insys executives, including its former CEO,  were criminally convicted in connection with the company&rsquo;s marketing practices,  and the company itself pled guilty to federal charges shortly before filing for  bankruptcy in June 2019.</p>
    <p align="left">&ldquo;There&rsquo;s no other way around it: Insys valued its  profits over people&rsquo;s lives,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison said. &ldquo;Minnesotans are  safer because it&rsquo;s now gone. Insys illegally marketed an extremely dangerous  and addictive opioid and made sham payments to health care professionals to  boost its sales.&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison continued, &ldquo;This bankruptcy plan  puts the company&rsquo;s remaining assets to use in combating the opioid epidemic  and compensating those hurt by its misconduct. It also holds the light of day  up to Insys&rsquo;s despicable behavior by giving the public access to its internal  documents, so everyone can see how it marketed this addictive drug solely to  increase its profits,&rdquo; he added.</p>
    <p align="left">&ldquo;No amount of money can fully compensate states and  communities â much less survivors and family members â for the death, damage,  and destruction that Insys and other opioid manufacturers have inflicted.  Still, a measure of justice has been done with this settlement that permanently  shuts down this very bad actor that has irreparably harmed too many  Minnesotans,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison concluded.</p>
    <p align="left">&ldquo;It is imperative that drugmakers market their products  in compliance with the law. Insys promoted a dangerous opioid beyond its  approved uses and made improper payments to Minnesota prescribers, putting the  public health at risk. By allowing Minnesota to recover from the bankruptcy  estate and closing the company&rsquo;s doors, this agreement protects Minnesotans and  makes Insys responsible for its misconduct,&rdquo; said Dr. Cody Wiberg, Executive  Director of the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy.</p>
    <p align="left">Insys manufactured the  immediate-release fentanyl drug Subsys, which was approved solely for the  treatment of excruciating cancer-related pain in opioid-tolerant patients.  Fentanyl is an opioid painkiller that is up to 100 times stronger than  morphine. Notwithstanding its narrow approval and potential deadliness, Insys  promoted Subsys for unapproved, &ldquo;off-label&rdquo; uses, seeking to increase profits  by marketing to prescribers who did not treat cancer patients and by pushing  dangerously high doses. Insys directed its sales representatives to &ldquo;move in&rdquo;  with one or two high-volume prescribers and offered commissions that rewarded  improper prescriptions and higher doses, telling its sales representatives to  think of Subsys patients as &ldquo;annuit[ies] that keep[] paying.&rdquo; Insys also paid  more than $43,000 to two high-volume Minnesota prescribers for &ldquo;speaker  programs,&rdquo; in violation of a Minnesota law prohibiting pharmaceutical  manufacturers from making payments to health care practitioners of more than  $50 per year.</p>
    <p align="left">Key outcomes from the bankruptcy include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Public  access to documents. </strong>Insys  will make public all of its sales, marketing and compliance documents related  to Subsys. This amounts to millions of documents, which will show how Insys  planned and executed its marketing of Subsys, how the company improperly  targeted and made payments to doctors, and the staggering effects of its  marketing in terms of amounts and doses of opioid prescriptions.</li>
      <li><strong>Monetary  recovery.&nbsp; </strong>Minnesota&rsquo;s  recovery will be placed into the state&rsquo;s opiate epidemic response fund, to be  administered by the Opioid Epidemic Response Advisory Council. While the total  value of the bankruptcy estate is yet to be determined, the governments and  tribes successfully negotiated the largest share of the estate out of all  creditor groups. The State of Minnesota&rsquo;s portion of that share will be worked  out amongst the government creditors in the coming months. </li>
      <li><strong>Restrictions  on future Subsys marketing.&nbsp; </strong>The  buyer of Subsys, BTcP Pharma, agreed to stringent restrictions on its future  marketing of Subsys. It will market Subsys only to cancer patients, and will  not operate a speaker program or market to prescribers that do not treat cancer  patients.</li>
      <li><strong>Compensation  for injured persons.</strong>&nbsp;  The bankruptcy plan protects claims of individual personal injury victims, who  have the potential for full recovery from a Victims Restitution Trust.</li>
    </ul>
    <p align="left">The Attorney General and the Minnesota Board of  Pharmacy joined a bipartisan coalition of state governments, led by the states  of Florida, Maryland, New Jersey, and New York, in voting last week to accept  the bankruptcy plan, which was negotiated by governments, insurers, hospitals,  trade creditors, and personal injury claimants.&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">Attorney General Ellison will continue to work to hold  other opioid companies accountable for the harm they caused. The Attorney  General&rsquo;s Office has a pending lawsuit against Purdue Pharma and its owners,  the Sackler family, for their role in fostering and sustaining the opioid  epidemic. Purdue Pharma filed for bankruptcy in September 2019, as Insys  earlier did. Attorney General Ellison and a bipartisan coalition of states  continue to pursue the action against Purdue in bankruptcy court. The Attorney  General&rsquo;s Office is also an active participant in ongoing multistate  investigations and negotiations with several other opioid manufacturers and  distributors.</p>
    <p align="left">Attorney  General Ellison supported passage of the state law enacted last year that  imposes registration fees on opioid manufacturers and distributors, directs any  funds the State recovers from its opioid litigation into a special fund, and  creates a council whose purpose is to use those fees to fund opioid education,  prevention, treatment, and recovery.&nbsp; Without this bill, proceeds from any  opioid settlement would have gone into the General Fund and could have been  appropriated for any purpose.</p>
    <p align="left">The  Attorney General&rsquo;s Office is running a public awareness campaign called &ldquo;Dose  of Reality&rdquo; to better educate the public about how to safely use, store, and  dispose of prescription painkillers. The Dose of Reality website is at <a href="http://doseofreality.mn.gov">doseofreality.mn.gov</a>. </p>
