<h1>AG Ellison sues ExxonMobil, Koch Industries & American Petroleum Institute for deceiving, defrauding Minnesotans about climate change
</h1>
	<p class="lede">Claims violations of state and common law regarding consumer fraud, deceptive trade practices, misrepresentation, failure to warn; seeks injunctive relief, restitution, and corrective public education campaign
</p>
	<p class="lede">Minnesota joins growing list of states and local governments holding fossil-fuel industry accountable for decades-long âcampaign of deceptionâ </p>
    <p><strong>June 24, 2020 (SAINT PAUL)</strong>âMinnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison  filed a <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/ExxonKochAPI_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> this morning in Ramsey County&nbsp; on behalf of the State and its residents to  stop deceptive practices related to climate change and to hold ExxonMobil  Corp., the American Petroleum Institute, and three Koch Industries entities  accountable for perpetuating fraud against Minnesotans.<strong> </strong>&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The lawsuit includes claims for  fraud, failure to warn, and multiple separate violations of Minnesota Statutes  that prohibit <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.69">consumer fraud</a>, <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325D.44">deceptive trade practices</a>, and <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.67">false statements in advertising</a>.<strong> </strong>In addition to an injunction  barring further violation of these laws,<strong> </strong>the complaint seeks restitution  for the harms Minnesotans have suffered, and asks the Court to require  defendants to fund a corrective public education campaign on the issue of  climate change. </p>
    <p>Minnesota joins a growing number  of governments that are seeking to hold companies responsible for harms  associated with climate change. While defendants and claims vary among  jurisdictions, at least 15 other plaintiffs have brought similar lawsuits to  date. Plaintiffs include the states of Massachusetts, New York, and Rhode Island,  along with cities and counties throughout the country. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;When corporations and trade  associations break the law and hurt Minnesotans, it&rsquo;s my job and my duty to  hold them accountable. The fraud, deceptive advertising, and other violations  of Minnesota state law and common law that the lawsuit shows they perpetrated  have harmed Minnesotans&rsquo; health and our state&rsquo;s environment, infrastructure,  and economy,&rdquo; said Attorney General Keith Ellison.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Impacts from climate change hurt  our low-income residents and communities of color first and worst. The impacts  on farmers in our agricultural state are widespread as well. Holding these  companies accountable for the climate deception they&rsquo;ve spread and continue to  spread is essential to helping families to afford their lives and live with  dignity and respect. It&rsquo;s only fair that, as our complaint states, &lsquo;the parties  who have profited from avoiding the consequences and costs of dealing with  global warming and its physical, environmental, social, and economic  consequences, bear the costs of those impacts, rather than Minnesota taxpayers,  residents, or broader segments of the public.&rsquo;&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The complaint asks the court to  require these companies to use wrongfully-obtained profits to help Minnesota  pay for the devastating consequences of climate change. Attorney General  Ellison is asking for these companies to disgorge profits and to &ldquo;fund a  corrective public education campaign in Minnesota relating to the issue of  climate change, administered and controlled by an independent third party,&rdquo; and  that defendants &ldquo;disclose, disseminate, and publish all research previously  conducted directly or indirectly . . . that relates to the issue of climate  change.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The complaint describes how these  companies strategized to deceive the public about climate-change science in  order to safeguard their business interests. It was uncovered only starting in  2015 that internal experts in the field of climate change at these companies  were issuing warnings to company leaders about what was coming. But rather than  warn the public, as was the companies&rsquo; duty, the complaint details a  multi-pronged campaign of deception that the companies and API conducted over  the past 30 years. </p>
    <p>During this same period,  ExxonMobil and Koch earned hundreds of billions of dollars in profits while  Minnesota shouldered the costs and consequences of unmitigated climate change. </p>
    <p>Two images released in the  complaint today illustrate the campaign of deception. One is a <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/ExxonKochAPI_ProprietaryInfo.pdf">document  from Exxon Engineering, labeled &ldquo;Proprietary Information,&rdquo;</a> dated October  19, 1979. It clearly asserts the reality of climate change and acknowledges  that the cause is &ldquo;due to fossil fuel consumption.&rdquo; The other image is of <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/ExxonKochAPI_Ads.pdf">print  advertisements from the Information Council for the Environment, an industry  front group</a> dedicated to denying the science of climate change. The ads  compare predictions of climate change to &ldquo;Chicken Little&rdquo; and assert that &ldquo;they  may not be true&rdquo; â despite the defendants&rsquo; knowledge that the predictions were  true. </p>
    
    <p>Minnesota has  a history of holding companies accountable for misleading the public. Under  former Minnesota Attorney General Skip Humphrey, Minnesota prosecuted Big  Tobacco for violating many of these same statutes.&nbsp;Doug&nbsp;Blanke, who  worked on the tobacco litigation and headed the Consumer Protection Division  while he was at the Attorney General&rsquo;s office, and now directs the Public  Health Law Center at Mitchell Hamline School of Law, thinks that Attorney  General Ellison has a strong case. &ldquo;Misleading the public about science is not  a new concept,&rdquo; he explains. &ldquo;Unfortunately, some companies seem to care more  about their bottom lines than the public&rsquo;s health. But it&rsquo;s a violation of  Minnesota law to mislead consumers about the products you sell, and the  Attorney General has laid out a powerful case that these companies did exactly  that.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Sam Grant,  executive director of MN350, added, &ldquo;As we come together to hold American  Petroleum Institute, Exxon, and Koch Industries accountable in this  consumer-protection lawsuit, it is important to be mindful that the harm caused  by their bad corporate behavior is not evenly experienced. Here in Minnesota,  it is our populations of color â particularly our urban African American  population and our American Indian population whether urban or rural â that  face the most grave health disparities, disparities contributed to by  corporations that have knowingly deceived the public, distorted the science,  and made tremendous profits while causing irreparable socio-environmental  harm.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Our future generations count on  our actions today,&rdquo; explains Winona LaDuke, director of Honor the Earth. &ldquo;As  fossil-fuel companies like Exxon twist laws and deal in carbon across the  world, people and governments are stopping them. I&rsquo;m proud that Minnesota is  stepping up.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>Juwaria Jama,  the state lead for Minnesota Youth Climate Strike, explains how young people  feel about this action: &ldquo;As generation z, we have known about climate change  ever since we were born. As children, we were told that we only had a few years  to act until our future could be stolen from us. Now as teenagers, that reality  is clearer. We are spending our time fighting a last-minute battle to preserve  a livable world for ourselves and future generations because corporations like  Exxon knew the impacts of climate change, but continued to deceive the public  for decades. Exxon chose profit over people. It&rsquo;s time they&rsquo;re held  accountable.&rdquo; </p>
    <h2>Impacts and costs of climate  change on Minnesota</h2>
    <p>According to the <a href="https://www.pca.state.mn.us/air/effects-climate-change-minnesota">Minnesota Pollution Control Agency</a>, from 1951 to 2012, Minnesota&rsquo;s climate  warmed faster than both national and global rates of increase, with average  annual temperature increasing by 3.2 degrees Fahrenheit in the  MinneapolisâSaint Paul metro area. According to the <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/climate/climate101.html">Minnesota Department of Health</a>, since 1960, the <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/ExxonKochAPI_TempGraphic.pdf">rate  of climate warming</a> in Minnesota has increased from 0.2 degrees Fahrenheit  per decade from the 1890s to the 1950s to 0.5 degrees Fahrenheit per decade  beginning with the 1960s. These and <a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/environment/climate/climate101.html">other</a> <a href="https://www.dnr.state.mn.us/climate/climate_change_info/climate-trends.html">studies</a> lay out many of the impacts of climate change on Minnesotans&rsquo;  health and Minnesota&rsquo;s environment and economy. </p>
    <p>Pages 57â70 of the <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/ExxonKochAPI_Complaint.pdf">lawsuit</a> also detail some of the many impacts and costs that Minnesota has incurred and  will incur as a result of climate change that has gone unchecked and  unregulated because of the defendants&rsquo; 30-year campaign of deception. </p>
    <p>A <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/docs/ExxonKochAPI_Complaint.pdf">copy  of the complaint</a> is available on Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s website. Video  of the press conference at which Attorney General Ellison and other speakers  announced the lawsuit will be available on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC24VphM2BVBQYrN2oTjjHUQ">Attorney  General Ellison&rsquo;s YouTube channel</a>. </p>
