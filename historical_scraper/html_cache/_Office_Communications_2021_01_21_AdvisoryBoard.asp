The Advisory Board is comprised of leading criminal-justice experts, including former Minnesota Supreme Court Justice Paul Anderson; Mark Osler, the chair of the independent panel that reviewed the case of Myon Burrell; and former Minneapolis NAACP President Leslie Redmond.

On an ongoing basis, it will advise on national best practices and evolving issues related to wrongful convictions and sentencing, and make policy recommendations. The board&rsquo;s first steps will be to approve the charter for the Conviction Review Unit, and to make a recommendation to the Attorney General about hiring the unit director.Â </p>
	
	<p>&ldquo;No justice system can be successful without the trust of the public,&rdquo; said Attorney General Ellison. &ldquo;By collaborating with community activists, national criminal-justice experts, and prosecutors, we are striving for a more perfect system.Â IÂ look forward to working with the board members to fulfill the mission of the CRU and thank them for theirÂ pursuit of justice.&rdquo;Â </p>
