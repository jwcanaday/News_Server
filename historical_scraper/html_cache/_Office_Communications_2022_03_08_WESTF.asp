<p><strong>March 8, 2022  (SAINT PAUL)</strong> â Today, on International Women&rsquo;s Day and after one year of  public study and deliberation, Minnesota Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Initiatives/WESA/Taskforce.asp">Advisory Task  Force on Expanding the Economic Security of Women</a> has released  a first-of-its-kind <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Initiatives/WESA/WESTF_Report.pdf">report and  115 recommendations</a> for advancing women&rsquo;s equal participation in the economy.</p>
<p>The  recommendations are rooted in an analysis of the four structural and cultural  factors that limit women's participation in the economy: the low cultural,  social, and economic value assigned to caregiving; pervasive power imbalances  in the economy, politics, and society; the low priority attached to women&rsquo;s  safety; and power imbalances in creating public policy. Â </p>
<p>The  task force&rsquo;s recommendations for short-, medium-, and long-term remedies to  these barriers flow from this analysis. They include 20 short- and medium-term  recommendations to strengthen the 2014 Women&rsquo;s Economic Security Act, several  of which are represented in currently active bills at the Minnesota  Legislature, and 95 more medium- and long-term recommendations for eliminating all  barriers to women&rsquo;s full participation in the economy and prosperity.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Initiatives/WESA/WESTF_Report.pdf">full report</a> and <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Initiatives/WESA/WESTF_Report_ExecSummary.pdf">executive summary</a>, both of  which include the recommendations, are available on Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s  website.</p>
<p>&ldquo;As  Attorney General, I work every day for a Minnesota where everyone can afford  their lives and live with dignity, safety, and respect â no exceptions. But every  day in Minnesota and across the country, women face barriers to economic  security and prosperity: be it through being chronically underpaid in  comparison to men, underrepresented in high-paying jobs, or squeezed out of the  job market because of a shortage of affordable childcare, or being victims of  sexism, discrimination, physical threats, and laws that regulate their bodily  autonomy that men do not face,&rdquo; <strong>Attorney General Ellison</strong> said. </p>
<p>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s  something in it for all of us to fix these problems, because when women have  full access to economic opportunity and face no more barriers in reaching their  full economic potential, everyone in Minnesota does better. Women&rsquo;s economic  security is everyone&rsquo;s economic security,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison added. &ldquo;The  report and recommendations are just the end of the beginning of turning this  ideal into reality. I&rsquo;m grateful to the task force members for building on the  good work of those who came before them, particularly those who fought for and  enacted the Women&rsquo;s Economic Security Act, to create this comprehensive, first-of-its-kind  report and recommendations. I&rsquo;m dedicated to fighting this fight with them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;When  we support the economic security of women in Minnesota, we are investing in the  economic security of our entire state,&rdquo; said <strong>Lieutenant Governor Peggy  Flanagan</strong>. &ldquo;I am excited that the work of this task force has culminated in  tangible recommendations that we can act on in this legislative session to  support women and children across Minnesota.&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>Task  Force co-chair Erin Maye Quade</strong> said, &ldquo;It has been an honor to serve as the co-chair of Attorney  General Ellison&rsquo;s Advisory Task Force on Expanding the Economic Security of  Women. With the persistent wage gap, lack of paid leave, dropping workforce  participation, and attacks on reproductive health, rights and justice, there  has never been a more urgent time for a framework to support women&rsquo;s economic  security in Minnesota. I&rsquo;m proud of the work our task force has done and, as  the advocacy director at Gender Justice, look forward to the work ahead of  implementing our recommendations.&rdquo;</p>
<h2>Structure  and analysis of the report</h2>
<p>In  clear language designed to be accessible to a wide range of Minnesotans, the  report takes a comprehensive approach that illustrates the complex relationship  between a wide set of social and economic issues that affect women&rsquo;s ability to  reach economic stability and prosperity. The report also provides a  retrospective analysis of the Women&rsquo;s Economic Security Act of 2014 (WESA),  highlighting effective provisions and opportunities for further gains. The Task  Force&rsquo;s commitment to approaching the work through an intersectional lens is  evident in the treatment of each issue area as well as in its wide-ranging set  of recommendations.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Initiatives/WESA/WESTF_Report.pdf">report</a> begins:</p>
	<div style="padding-left:30px;">
<p>Women in Minnesota continue to experience barriers and challenges  to economic security and prosperity despite their critical role in our society,  families, and economy. In general, they are paid less than men, are  overrepresented in low-paying jobs, take on the majority of unpaid caregiving and  housework, and are more likely to live in poverty. The 2014 Women&rsquo;s Economic  Security Act (WESA) expanded economic opportunity and strengthened workplace protections  for women. In order to build on its gains, Attorney General Keith Ellison  created the Advisory Task Force on Expanding the Economic Security of Women in  Minnesota to:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Carry out a retrospective review of WESA;</li>
  <li>Identify ongoing structural, cultural, organizational, and legal  barriers to gender equity in the workplace and in the economy at large, taking  into account intersectional impacts and the effects of the COVID-19pandemic;  and</li>
  <li>Create a set of recommendations that offer possible strategies,  models, and solutions to advance the economic security of women.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p><strong>Section 2</strong> of the  report describes four of the major cultural values and structural processes  that anchor the challenges identified by the Task Force: </p>
<ol>
  <li>the low value assigned to caregiving; </li>
  <li>a pervasive power imbalance;</li>
  <li>the low prioritization of women&rsquo;s safety; and</li>
  <li>power imbalances in creating public policy. </li>
</ol>

<p><strong>Section 3</strong> of the  report assesses the effective components of WESA as well as opportunities for  furthering its impact. Here the Task Force provides its first 20  recommendations that target the key provisions of WESA: wage disclosure,  pregnancy accommodations, pregnancy and parenting leave, nursing mothers, sick  and safe leave, wage gaps, and early learning scholarships. Among those  recommendations are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Expanding WESA to cover all employers, regardless of size.</li>
  <li>Expanding access to WESA pregnancy and parenting leave  accommodations by allowing employees to participate regardless of their tenure  on the job.</li>
  <li>Supporting paid family and medical leave and earned sick and safe  leave.</li>
  <li>Increasing funding for Early Learning Scholarships to fully cover  income-eligible families (or limit their costs to 7% of their household income)  to give more children access to high- quality early learning programs.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Section 4 </strong>of the report  provides a thorough scan of structural, cultural, organizational, legal, and  regulatory barriers to gender equity and conducts a comprehensive analysis of  various strategies that that can be undertaken to advance the economic security  of women. The Task Force provides 95 recommendations in 18 distinct issue areas  related to the workplace, caregiving, health, economic opportunity, and  governance. Among those recommendations are:<br>
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Banning employer inquiries into salary history.</li>
  <li>Supporting passage of the Equal Rights Amendment at the state and  federal levels to offer protection from gender discrimination broadly.</li>
  <li>Supporting unionization of women, growth in organized labor, and  laws that make it easier to organize, especially in women-dominated industries.</li>
  <li>Supporting government subsidized, low-cost, high-quality  childcare, especially for low-income children.</li>
  <li>Expanding &ldquo;next of kin&rdquo; language in Minnesota statutes to include  extended family and even nonfamilial relationships to account for varying  (including cultural) caregiving structures.</li>
  <li>Exploring models that enable women to earn social security credit  for hours spent caregiving.</li>
  <li>Investing in increased resources for childcare center startups in  Greater Minnesota to combat barriers to launching their business (such as  adequate building acquisition), prioritizing culturally competent providers.</li>
  <li>Expanding access to MinnesotaCare so that all Minnesotans are able  to use it, regardless of their employment status or use of other public  benefits.</li>
  <li>Codifying the right to an abortion into law and ensuring that  health insurance covers reproductive healthcare, including abortion.</li>
  <li>Explore the potentially discriminatory use of racial data in  medical algorithms to justify unequal assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of  Minnesotans of color.</li>
  <li>Strongly supporting infrastructure investments for broadband.</li>
  <li>Ensuring that no Minnesotan can be denied housing only because  they access rental assistance.</li>
  <li>Researching means by which to hold accountable under new or  existing law rental property owners and companies that chronically provide  substandard housing.</li>
  <li>Supporting increased business development support and financial  resources for women entrepreneurs, especially for women of color and American  Indian women.</li>
  <li>Reinstituting and funding the Legislative Office on the Economic  Status of Women.</li>
</ul>
<p>&ldquo;The  Task Force&rsquo;s report offers more than 100 recommendations, a number of which can  be implemented now,&rdquo; said <strong>Attorney General Ellison.</strong> &ldquo;I look forward to  the work ahead of us in partnering with the legislature, employers, and  community members to turn them from recommendations into reality and to make  Minnesota the most prosperous and economically secure state for women â which  means for everyone.&rdquo;</p>

Each meeting  was dedicated to dissecting portions of the Task Force&rsquo;s goals with expert  topical presentations, surveys, and facilitated discussion.
