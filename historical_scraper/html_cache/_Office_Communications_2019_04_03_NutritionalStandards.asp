<h1>
Attorney General Ellison joins multistate coalition suing Trump Administration for gutting key nutritional standards for school meals
</h1>
 <!--TITLE-->
	<p class="lede">At least 600,000 Minnesota schoolchildren affected by âunlawfulâ revisions to sodium limits, whole-grain content requirements for school breakfasts and lunches</p>
 
 
    <p><strong>April 3, 2019 (Saint  Paul) </strong>â<strong> </strong>Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison today announced he has joined a  multistate coalition in a lawsuit against the Trump Administration for  illegally weakening key federal nutritional standards for breakfasts and  lunches served at least 600,000 schoolchildren in Minnesota and nearly 30  million&nbsp;schoolchildren in the United States. The coalition, led by  New&nbsp;York&nbsp;Attorney General Letitia James, contends that the U.S.  Department of Agriculture&rsquo;s (USDA) rollback of sodium limits and whole-grain  requirements for school meals lacks legally-mandated scientific basis and in  further violation of law, was adopted without public notice and opportunity to  comment.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;All parents want to  know that their kids are healthy and will do anything to make sure they are.  Low-income parents rely on healthy school breakfasts and lunches to help them  with that. It&rsquo;s one way they try like everyone else to afford their lives and  live with dignity. So it&rsquo;s cruel that the Trump Administration would lower  standards that could make low-income kids&rsquo; meals less healthy â and galling  that they didn&rsquo;t even follow the law in doing so,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison  said.</p>
    <p>In 2018, more than 600,000 Minnesota schoolchildren  participated in the school-lunch program, and more than 200,000 in the  school-breakfast program, with some children participating in both. Those  children consumed more than 100 million meals in 2018. In the United States,  nearly 30 million school children consumed nearly 5 billion school lunch and  more than 14 million school breakfasts.</p>
    <p>School  meal programs are especially important for children in low-income families; in  2018, more than 74 percent of school lunches and 85 percent of school  breakfasts provided to schoolchildren in the United States were offered free or  at a reduced price. Further, according to USDA&rsquo;s own figures, a  disproportionately high share of students participating in the national school  lunch and breakfast programs are African American or Latino/a.&nbsp;</p>
    <p>In 2018, the Trump  Administration, after soliciting no public comment as required by law, gutted a  2012 USDA rule setting updated nutritional standards for whole-grain and sodium  content for school meals. By contrast, the 2012 rule was made after receiving more  than 100,000 public comments. The Trump Administration also failed to follow  the law by stating how its changes were consistent with previously established  dietary guidelines for school meals. </p>
    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>Established  in 1946, the National School Lunch Program is a federally subsidized program  that provides students with healthy, balanced meals in schools at low- or  no-cost. Since that time, Congress has taken action to ensure that program&rsquo;s  nutritional guidelines keep current with the best scientific evidence with the  most recent modernization occurring in 2010 with the Healthy Hunger-Free Kids  Act.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>In 1994, Congress acted to require school meals to be  consistent with the Dietary Guidelines for Americans, nutritional and dietary  information, and guidelines for the general public that are jointly issued by  USDA and the Department of Health and Human Services. In 2010, Congress  directed USDA to update the nutritional requirements based on a 2009 study by  the Food and Nutrition Board, which is part of the National Academy of  Sciences.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The Food and Nutrition Board study found that the daily  sodium intake for schoolchildren &ldquo;clearly was excessive,&rdquo; and at levels  significantly above the Dietary Guidelines. The study cited scientific evidence  that showed a relationship between sodium intake and blood pressure in children  as well, and that &ldquo;high blood pressure responds to a reduction in salt intake  in children as in adults.&rdquo; Consequently, the Food and Nutrition Board Study  recommended sodium limits for school meals based on the Dietary  Guidelines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The study also found &ldquo;extremely low&rdquo; consumption of  whole grains by schoolchildren. USDA has recognized that whole grains are an  important source of iron, magnesium, selenium, B vitamins, and dietary fiber,  and that eating whole grains in nutrient dense forms may lower body weight and  reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. The study recommended that grain  products served in schools be &ldquo;whole grain-rich&rdquo; â i.e., contain at least 51%  whole grains â as recommended by the Dietary Guidelines.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>In 2010, Congress enacted the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids  Act, which directed USDA to issue revised nutritional standards for school  lunches and breakfasts. After public notice and extensive comment on the  proposed rule â over 133,000 public comments were considered â in 2012, USDA  issued new, updated nutritional standards for school meals. These updates  included, for the first time, interim and final limits for sodium, as well as a  requirement increasing the whole grains in school meals. In accordance with federal  law, the standards set for sodium and whole grain were consistent with the  Dietary Guidelines and the recommendations of the Food and Nutrition Board  study.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Most schools across the nation have now met the first  sodium reduction target of the 2012 regulation. Further, the majority of  schools are now meeting the regulation&rsquo;s standard by serving bread, pancakes,  pasta, and other foods to students that are entirely whole-grain rich.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Despite this substantial progress, in 2018, the Trump  Administration&rsquo;s USDA issued a rule that dismantled key nutrition standards set  by the 2012 Rule, eliminating the final maximum sodium target, delaying by five  years the second intermediate maximum-sodium target that had been set for the  2019-2020 school year, and cutting in half the whole grains requirement. In  issuing the rule, the Trump USDA failed to explain how the changes to the  sodium and whole grain nutrition standards for school meals were, as required  by law, &ldquo;consistent with of the goals of the latest Dietary Guidelines for  Americans&rdquo; and &ldquo;based on&rdquo; the Food and Nutrition Board study&rsquo;s recommendations.  Further, the 2018 rule was neither issued as a proposed rule nor was the public  provided an opportunity to comment on it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Joining Attorney General Ellison in today&rsquo;s lawsuit are  the Attorneys General of California, the District of Columbia, Illinois, New  Mexico, New York, and Vermont.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>The lawsuit was filed today in U.S. District Court for  the Southern District of New York.&nbsp;A <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/sites/default/files/usda_complaint.pdf">copy of the  lawsuit</a> is available on the website of New York Attorney General Letitia  James. </p>
