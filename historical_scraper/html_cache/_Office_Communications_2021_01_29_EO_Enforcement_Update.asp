    </ul>
    <h2>Minnesota Department of HealthÂ </h2>
    <h3>Enforcement authorityÂ </h3>
    <p>The Minnesota Department of Health&rsquo;s Environmental Health Division is responsible for regulating restaurants among other facilities. The division uses the following tools, escalating through the list depending on each situation.Â </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documenting inspection findings and writing orders for correction on inspection reports.Â Â This tool was used as the starting point for businesses violating previous EO requirements such as requiring the use of face coverings by employees or lack of a COVID plan but will not be used for EO 20-99 violations.Â </li>
      <li>10-day letter â Functions as a notice of violation that outlines the alleged violations and warns of the risk of fines up to $10,000 and licensure action.Â </li>
