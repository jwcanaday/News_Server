Sackler family knew but denied and downplayed risks of opioids, stigmatized addicted people, then moved to profit from addiction
</h1>
	<p class="lede">AG Ellisonâs office files unredacted complaint that shows family that controls Purdue paid themselves $4B in profit from opioids, while calling addicted people âcriminals,â âscum of the earthâ â then exploiting addiction treatment as an âattractive marketâ that is ânaturally linkedâ to the crisis they created
</p>
	<p class="lede">AG Ellison: Complaint shows Sacklers âmotivated not by human dignity or the value of human life, but by unlimited greed above all elseâ </p>
	
	
	<p><strong>August&nbsp;5,&nbsp;2019&nbsp;(SAINT  PAUL)</strong> â The Sackler family that  controls Purdue Pharma â the manufacturer of the blockbuster opioid OxyContin  and other opioids â knew as early as 20 years ago of the risks of addiction and  death that their products posed, but denied and downplayed those risks,  stigmatized addicted people, then moved to profit from the market for addiction  treatment. All this and more is revealed in the <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Cases/PurduePharma/FirstAmendedComplaint_Final.pdf">unredacted  First Amended Complaint against Purdue and eight members of the Sackler family</a><strong></strong>â Richard Sackler, Kathe Sackler, Mortimer D.A. Sackler, Jonathan  Sackler, David Sackler, Ilene Sackler Lefcourt, Beverly Sackler, and Theresa  Sackler â who are named as individual defendants. Minnesota Attorney General  Keith Ellison&rsquo;s office filed the unredacted First Amended Complaint today in  Hennepin County District Court.</p>
    <p>Notably, the amended  complaint reveals that the Sackler defendants, who controlled Purdue at all  times, paid themselves a total $4 billion in profits they made off opioids  nationally, including tens of millions of dollars in profits that they made off  Minnesotans. They enriched themselves while calling people who were addicted to  OxyContin, an opioid they knew was twice as powerful as morphine, &ldquo;culprits,&rdquo;  &ldquo;reckless criminals,&rdquo; and &ldquo;scum of the earth.&rdquo; Then, the amended complaint  reveals, they realized that treating addiction was an &ldquo;attractive market&rdquo; that  was &ldquo;naturally linked&rdquo; to the crisis they had created and moved to profit from addiction  treatment as their next business opportunity.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;The unredacted complaint  makes it starkly clear that the Sackler defendants were motivated not by human  dignity or the value of human life, but by unlimited greed above all else,&rdquo;  Attorney General Ellison said. &ldquo;The Sackler defendants knew they were  distorting facts, deceiving people, and destroying lives, and they kept going  for the sake of greed. They didn&rsquo;t see addiction, epidemic, and death as  reasons to change course â they saw them as opportunities for profit.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;On behalf of the people of  Minnesota, my office and I are doing everything we can to hold the Sackler  defendants personally accountable for the irreparable pain and damage they  willingly inflicted on every part of our state in the pursuit of their greed,&rdquo;  Ellison concluded.</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.health.state.mn.us/communities/opioids/documents/2017opioiddeathreport.pdf">From 2000 through 2017, a total 3,628 Minnesotans died  of opioid-involved overdoses</a>,  including 422 in 2017 alone, the highest yearly figure yet recorded by the  Minnesota Department of Health. From 2000 to 2017, the number of Minnesotans  who died from opioid-related overdoses increased nearly 800 percent.</p>
    <p>The unredacted complaint  reveals that when defendant Richard Sackler learned as early as 2001 of a  federal prosecutor&rsquo;s report that 59 people had died of opioid-related overdoses  in a single state, he wrote to Purdue executives that &ldquo;[t]his is not too bad.  It could have been far worse.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>Additionally, the unredacted  complaint shows how the Sackler defendants reacted to and actively attempted to  influence Minnesota&rsquo;s pain-management standards to their benefit.</p>
    <p>The State of Minnesota first  filed suit against Purdue in Hennepin County District Court on  July&nbsp;2,&nbsp;2018. In the suit,  the State alleges consumer fraud, including that Purdue deliberately minimized  the addiction risk of long-term opioid use and failed to sufficiently disclose  the risks of long-term opioid use; deceptive and unlawful trade practices,  including that Purdue made misrepresentations designed to mislead healthcare  providers about the benefits of opioids; false statements in advertising;  public nuisance; unjust enrichment; false claims; and other causes of action. </p>
    <p>On May&nbsp;17,&nbsp;2019,  Attorney General Ellison announced that his office had <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/05/17_PurdueAmendedComplaint.asp">amended the original complaint against Purdue Pharma  to include eight members of the Sackler family, which controls Purdue, as  individual defendants</a>. The amended  complaint the State filed at that time was redacted. Today, Attorney General  Ellison&rsquo;s office filed the unredacted complaint, which allows the public to  learn about the Sacklers&rsquo; words and conduct directly from internal company  documents.&nbsp; </p>
    <p>Below are excerpts from the <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Cases/PurduePharma/FirstAmendedComplaint_Final.pdf">unredacted  complaint</a> filed today, with paragraph and page numbers from the complaint  supplied for reference, that show in verbatim quotes and stark detail that: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The Sackler  defendants were personally behind Purdue&rsquo;s deception about OxyContin&rsquo;s risk of  abuse and addiction;</li>
      <li>The Sackler  defendants were personally aware of the risks of abuse and addiction with  OxyContin as early as 1999 â and intentionally blamed individuals for it;</li>
      <li>Despite their  denials that opioids were addictive, the Sackler defendants moved to profit  from treatments for addiction; </li>
      <li>The Sackler  defendants also monitored and attempted to influence Minnesota pain-management  standards and education;</li>
      <li>The Sackler  defendants were personally involved in maximizing returns from OxyContin from  the start; and</li>
      <li>The Sackler  defendants paid themselves $4 billion in opioid profits, including tens of  millions of dollars they made off of Minnesotans.</li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Newly-unredacted language  from the complaint that is publicly available for the first time today is  highlighted in bold.</strong> Other previously  released passages are <em>highlighted in</em> <em>italics for emphasis</em>.</p>
    
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>I. The  Sackler defendants were personally behind Purdue&rsquo;s deception about OxyContin&rsquo;s  risk of abuse and addiction. </strong><em>(<strong>Â¶225, p.&nbsp;67)</strong></em></p>
      <ul><li>For example, in 1997, Richard and Kathe Sackler, along  with other Purdue executives, were <em>personally involved in the decision to  perpetuate health care providers&rsquo; misconception that OxyContin was weaker than  morphine</em>, which led a wide variety of health care providers to prescribe  OxyContin much more often. For instance, Purdue executive Michael Friedman (who  later pleaded guilty to federal criminal charges of misbranding OxyContin due  to his actions at Purdue) told Richard Sackler in May&nbsp;1997 that the  company was <strong>&ldquo;well aware of the view, held by many physicians, that oxycodone  is weaker than morphine,&rdquo;</strong> but opined that <strong>&ldquo;it would be extremely  dangerous, at this early stage in the life of [OxyContin], to tamper with this  &lsquo;personality,&rsquo; to make physicians think the drug is stronger or equal to  morphine.&rdquo;</strong> <em>Richard agreed with this approach despite knowing that, in  reality, OxyContin is about twice as potent as morphine.</em> <em>(<strong>Â¶226,  pp.&nbsp;67-8)</strong></em></li>
      <li>Around the same time, Richard Sackler was personally  involved in correcting what he believed was a <strong>&ldquo;critical misconception&rdquo;</strong>:  that experts believed that OxyContin <strong>&ldquo;has a ceiling effect&rdquo;</strong> which would  limit health care providers from prescribing higher doses of the drug. Richard  asked Michael Friedman to <strong>&ldquo;put together some approaches and test whether  they would be potent weapons&rdquo;</strong> in <strong>&ldquo;smash[ing] this critical misconception.&rdquo; </strong><em>(<strong>Â¶228, p.&nbsp;68)</strong></em></li>
      <li>From the start, the Sackler Defendants were also the  driving force behind Purdue&rsquo;s marketing strategy to push opioids with the false  promise that they create an enhanced <strong>&ldquo;lifestyle.&rdquo;</strong> In 1998, Richard  Sackler personally instructed Purdue&rsquo;s executives that OxyContin tablets  provide more than merely <strong>&ldquo;therapeutic&rdquo;</strong> value and instead <strong>&ldquo;enhance  personal performance,&rdquo;</strong> like Viagra. <strong><em>(Â¶230, p.&nbsp;69)</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
   
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>II. The  Sackler defendants knew of OxyContin&rsquo;s risk of abuse and addiction as early as  1999 â and intentionally blamed individuals for it. <em>(Â¶238, p.&nbsp;72)</em></strong></p>
      <ul> <li>In January 2001, Richard Sackler received an email from a  Purdue sales representative describing a community meeting at a local high  school organized by mothers whose children overdosed on OxyContin and died. The  sales representative reported that <strong>&ldquo;[s]tatements were made that OxyContin  sales were at the expense of dead children and the only difference between  heroin and OxyContin is that you can get OxyContin from a doctor.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶239,  p.&nbsp;72)</em></strong></li>
      <li>In February&nbsp;2001, a federal prosecutor reported 59  deaths from OxyContin in a single state. Richard Sackler&rsquo;s reaction, in an  email to Purdue executives, was that <strong>&ldquo;[t]his is not too bad. It could have  been far worse.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶240, p.&nbsp;72)</em></strong></li>
      <li>At the end of 2000, Time Magazine published an article  about OxyContin deaths, and Purdue employees told Richard Sackler they were  concerned. Richard responded in early 2001 with a message to his staff. He  wrote that Time&rsquo;s coverage of people who lost their lives to OxyContin was not <strong>&ldquo;balanced,&rdquo;</strong> and the deaths were the fault of <strong>&ldquo;the drug addicts,&rdquo;</strong> not Purdue. He  claimed that the increasing sales of OxyContin made Purdue a <strong>&ldquo;target for  sensational reports in the media,&rdquo;</strong> and implored Purdue staff to <strong>&ldquo;continue  to focus upon our noble mission.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶241, p&nbsp;72-3)</em></strong></li>
      <li>Throughout 2001, <em>Richard Sackler personally dictated  Purdue&rsquo;s strategy for responding to the increasing evidence of abuse of  prescription opioids and addiction to Purdue&rsquo;s opioids: blame and stigmatize  victims of opioid addiction.</em> He wrote in an email that <strong>&ldquo;we have to  hammer on the abusers in every way possible. They are the culprits and the  problem. They are the reckless criminals.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶242, p.&nbsp;73)</em></strong></li>
      <li>That same year, in an email exchange discussing whether  people dependent on opioids <strong>&ldquo;want to be addicts,&rdquo;</strong> Richard wrote: <strong>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll  tell you something that will totally revise your belief that addicts don&rsquo;t want  to be addicted. It is factually untrue. They get themselves addicted over and  over again.&rdquo;</strong> Richard emphasized: <strong>&ldquo;[Opioid addicts] are criminals, and  they engage in it with full, criminal intent. Why should they be entitled to  our sympathies?&rdquo;</strong> He further wrote: <strong>&ldquo;This vilification is shit.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶243,  p.&nbsp;73)</em></strong></li>
      <li>In another email exchange that year, Richard said that  those who abused opioids <strong>&ldquo;aren&rsquo;t victims; they are victimizers. And we  decent people are the people they attack.&rdquo;</strong> In earlier correspondence with  the same person, Richard had complained that he couldn&rsquo;t <strong>&ldquo;call[] drug  addicts &lsquo;scum of the earth&rsquo;&rdquo;</strong> because he would <strong>&ldquo;become the poster child  for liberals who â¦ just want to distribute the blame to someone else.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶244,  p.&nbsp;73)</em></strong><br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
    </ul>
   
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>III. The  Sackler defendants&rsquo; understanding of the risk of opioid addiction is  underscored by their moves to profit from addiction. <em>(Â¶283, p.&nbsp;84)</em></strong></p>
      <ul> <li><em>Richard and Kathe Sackler, along with Purdue staff,  determined that the millions of people who became addicted to opioids were the  Sackler Defendants&rsquo; next business opportunity.</em> Staff reported to Kathe that  opioid addiction treatment <strong>&ldquo;is an attractive market&rdquo;</strong> with a <strong>&ldquo;[l]arge  unmet need for vulnerable, underserved and stigmatized patient population  suffering from substance abuse, dependence and addiction.&rdquo; <em>(Â¶283,  p.&nbsp;84)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>In September&nbsp;2014, Kathe Sackler participated in a call  about Project Tangoâa plan for Purdue to expand into the business of selling  drugs to treat opioid addiction. In internal Purdue documents, Kathe Sackler  and staff memorialized what Purdue publicly denied for decades: <strong>&ldquo;Pain  treatment and addiction are naturally linked.&rdquo; <em>(Â¶284, p.&nbsp;84-5)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>Kathe Sackler and Purdue staff illustrated this point, and  the business opportunity it presented, as a funnel that began with pain  treatment leading into addiction treatment which emphasized Purdue&rsquo;s <strong>&ldquo;opportunity  to expand our offering as an end-to-end pain provider&rdquo;</strong> <em>[See graphic in  amended complaint entitled <strong>&ldquo;Addiction treatment is a good fit and new  natural step for Purdue&rdquo;</strong>]</em> <strong><em>(Â¶285, p.&nbsp;85)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>The same presentation also provided that opioid addiction  can <strong>&ldquo;happen to anyoneâfrom a 50 year old woman with chronic lower back pain  to a 18 year old boy with a sports injury, from the very wealthy to the very  poor.&rdquo;</strong> <em>This internal statement directly contradicts Purdue&rsquo;s  public-facing message that opioid addiction only affects patients that are  already predisposed to addiction. <strong>(Â¶286, p.&nbsp;85)</strong></em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>Kathe Sackler and Purdue&rsquo;s Project Tango team reviewed  findings that sales of treatment medication to people addicted to opioids had  more than doubled from 2009 to 2014. <em>Kathe and the staff found that the  national catastrophe Defendants caused provided an excellent compound growth  rate (&ldquo;CAGR&rdquo;)</em>: <strong>&ldquo;Opioid addiction (other than heroin) has grown by ~20%  CAGR from 2000 to 2010.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶287, p.&nbsp;85-6)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>In February 2015, staff presented Kathe Sackler&rsquo;s work on  Project Tango to the Purdue board. The plan was for a <strong>joint venture  controlled by the Sackler Defendants to sell</strong> <strong>Suboxone film</strong> and  acquire an addiction medicine pipeline. The presentation claimed that this  would result in the Sackler Defendants&rsquo; acquisition of the <strong>&ldquo;market lead[] in  the addiction medicine space.&rdquo; <em>(Â¶289, p.&nbsp;86)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>During the presentation, the Tango team <em>outlined how  patients could get addicted to prescription opioid analgesics, like OxyContin,  or heroin, and then become consumers of the joint venture&rsquo;s </em><strong>Suboxone  film</strong><em>âand likely become repeat customers</em>, as the presentation noted a <strong>&ldquo;40â60% relapse rate in 1 year.&rdquo;<em> (Â¶290, p.&nbsp;86)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;</li>
      <li>In June 2016, the Sackler Defendants met to discuss a  revised version of Project Tango and considered a different scheme to sell the  opioid overdose antidote Narcanâ¦ The Sackler Defendants viewed Narcan as a <strong>&ldquo;complementary&rdquo; </strong>product to their opioid portfolio, and identified patients on Purdue&rsquo;s  prescription opioids as the target market for Narcan. Their plan called for  studying <strong>&ldquo;long-term script users&rdquo;</strong> to <strong>&ldquo;better understand target end  patients&rdquo;</strong> for Narcan. The Sackler Defendants planned to <strong>&ldquo;leverage the  current Purdue sales force&rdquo;</strong> to <strong>&ldquo;drive direct promotion to targeted  opioid prescribers&rdquo;</strong> and determined that Purdue could profit from government  efforts to use Narcan to save lives, <em>including specifically in Minnesota,  because Minnesota allows dispensing of naloxone without a prescription.</em> <strong><em>(Â¶Â¶291-2,  pp.&nbsp;86-7)</em></strong></li>
      <li>In December 2016, Richard, Jonathan, and Mortimer Sackler  had a call with staff regarding yet another version of Project Tango: <strong>acquisition  of a company that treated opioid addiction with implantable drug pumps.</strong> The  business was a <strong>&ldquo;strategic fit,&rdquo;</strong> because Purdue sold opioids and the new  business treated the <strong>&ldquo;strategically adjacent indication of opioid  dependence.&rdquo;</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶293, p. 87)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
    </ul>
    
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>IV. The  Sackler defendants monitored and directed Purdue&rsquo;s influence of Minnesota pain  management standards and education. <em>(Â¶235, p.&nbsp;70-71)</em></strong></p>
      <ul><li>For example, in 2000, Michael Friedman sent Richard Sackler  a report from a Purdue representative&rsquo;s visit <strong>with the Minnesota Board of  Medical Practice</strong>. The Purdue representative reported that <strong>the Board was  using a video to educate physicians about chronic pain patients that encouraged  physicians to utilize &ldquo;careful prescribing, vigilance, documentation,&rdquo; and  &ldquo;vigorous[]&rdquo; </strong>management of chronic pain patients to avoid<strong> &ldquo;manipulative  behavior of addicted persons in their need to secure [opioid] drugs.&rdquo;</strong> In  response, Richard called the representative&rsquo;s description <strong>of the video</strong> <strong>&ldquo;illuminating  and scary,&rdquo;</strong> and asked a series of questions: <br>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>What sort of take away is it that if you treat patients  with chronic severe pain and they get better they want you to continue the treatment.  Is this a surprise? And why can&rsquo;t they give better advice than to say that they  appear to disapprove the use of opioids in such treatments? That isn&rsquo;t very  helpful, either.</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶235, p.&nbsp;70-71)</em></strong></li></ul>
      <li>In 2001, Michael Friedman then informed Richard and other  Sackler Defendants that Purdue was setting up <strong>&ldquo;educational pain management  programs&rdquo;</strong> throughout Minnesota, funded by a <strong>&ldquo;significant unrestricted  grant from Purdue.&rdquo;</strong> These programs asserted that <strong>Minnesota health care  providers&rsquo; reluctance to prescribe opioids was misplaced, that patient pain was  being under-treated, and that Minnesota health care providers could treat &ldquo;the  pseudoaddict.&rdquo;</strong> The Sackler Defendants were told by Purdue staff that these  Minnesota programs would <strong>serve as a model that was being replicated by  Purdue in other states.</strong> <strong><em>(Â¶236, p.&nbsp;71)</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
      </li>
      
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>V. Richard  Sackler was personally involved in maximizing OxyContin&rsquo;s returns for Purdue  from the start. <em>(Â¶224, p.&nbsp;67)</em></strong></p>
    <ul>
	<li>At the OxyContin launch party, Richard asked the  audience to imagine a series of natural disasters: an earthquake, a volcanic  eruption, a hurricane, and most importantly, a blizzard. Richard then claimed  to have spoken with the <strong>&ldquo;Wise One&rdquo;</strong> during a journey <strong>&ldquo;high in the  Himalayas,&rdquo;</strong> and boasted that the <strong>&ldquo;Wise One&rdquo;</strong> had told him that <strong>&ldquo;the  launch of OxyContin Tablets will be followed by a blizzard of prescriptions  that will bury the competition. The prescription blizzard will be so deep,  dense, and white that you will never see their [w]hite [f]lag.&rdquo; <em>(Â¶224,  p.&nbsp;67)</em></strong></li>
    </ul>
    
      <p>&nbsp;</p>
      <p><strong>VI. The  Sackler defendants paid themselves $4 billion in opioid profits, including tens  of millions of dollars earned in Minnesota. <em>(Â¶Â¶298-300, p.&nbsp;84)</em></strong></p>
     <ul> <li>According to publicly available information, annual revenue  at Purdue averaged about $3&nbsp;billion, mainly due to OxyContin sales, and  Purdue has made more than $35&nbsp;billion since releasing OxyContin in  1995.&nbsp; According to Purdue board documents, <em>Purdue, at the direction of  the Sackler-controlled board, paid the Sackler families approximately </em><strong>$4&nbsp;billion</strong><em> in profits stemming from the sale of Purdue&rsquo;s opioids between 2007 and 2018.</em> <strong><em>(Â¶298, p.&nbsp;89)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>Purdue also projected that the Sackler Defendants would  be paid billions more. In June&nbsp;2010, Purdue&rsquo;s staff gave the Sackler  Defendants an updated 10-year plan for growing Purdue&rsquo;s opioid sales, in which <em>the  Sackler Defendants stood to receive at least </em><strong>$700&nbsp;million</strong><em> each year from 2010 through 2020. <strong>(Â¶299, p.&nbsp;89)</strong></em> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
      <li>Purdue and the Sackler Defendants tracked revenue from Minnesota.  For example, after the 2016 CDC guideline was released, staff analyzed the  potential negative effect of the guideline on Purdue&rsquo;s opioid sales and  reported to the Sackler Defendants that the approximately <strong>40,000</strong> annual  prescriptions of Purdue&rsquo;s high-dose opioids in Minnesota provided Purdue nearly <strong>$20 million</strong> per year, or about <strong>2.3%</strong> of Purdue&rsquo;s annual high-dose  opioid sales. If this percentage is applied to the overall distributions paid  to the Sackler Defendants since May&nbsp;15,&nbsp;2007, <em>the Sackler Defendants  have paid their family approximately </em><strong>$92,000,000</strong><em> from Minnesota.</em> <strong><em>(Â¶300, p.&nbsp;89)</em></strong> <strong>&nbsp;</strong></li>
