<h1>State of Minnesota enforcement authority and penalties for violations of Executive Orders: January 8, 2021 Update
</h1>
	<h2>Attorney General&rsquo;s Office Â  </h2>
	<h3>Enforcement authorityÂ </h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>Executive Order 20-99, as modified and extended by 20-103, grants the following enforcement authority to the Attorney General:Â Â &ldquo;â¦ the Attorney General, as well as city and county attorneys, may investigate and seek any civil relief available pursuant to Minnesota Statutes 2020, section 8.31, for violations or threatened violations of this Executive Order, including but not limited to injunctive relief, civil penalties in an amount to be determined by the court, up to $25,000 per occurrence, costs of investigation and reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees and costs, and other equitable relief as determined by the court in accordance with section 8.31.&rdquo;</li>
	  <li>Under Minnesota Statutes section 8.31, the Attorney General &ldquo;â¦ shall investigate violations of the law of this state respecting unfair, discriminatory, and other unlawful practices in business, commerce, or trade&rdquo; (subd. 1). It provides that &ldquo;[o]n becoming satisfied that any of those laws has been or is being violated, or is about to be violated, the attorney general shall be entitled, on behalf of the state; (a) to sue for and have injunctive relief in any court of competent jurisdiction against any such violation or threatened violation without abridging the penalties provided by law; and (b) to sue for and recover for the state, from any person who is found to have violated any of the laws referred to in subdivision 1, a civil penalty, in an amount to be determined by the court, not in excess of $25,000&rdquo; (subd. 3). It also provides that the Attorney General can obtain equitable relief, which includes restitution and/or disgorgement and its costs and reasonable attorney&rsquo;s fees for violations (subd. 3a).Â </li>
    </ul>
	<h3>Enforcement actions under 20-99, as modified and extended by 20-103Â </h3>

	<ul>
	  <li><strong>Carlson Event Center: </strong>The Attorney General&rsquo;s office filed a lawsuit against Carlson Event Center in Winnebago, Minn., on Dec. 30, 2020, for planning an indoor event in in violation of Executive Order 20-99, as modified and extended by EO 20-103.Â <strong>The office won a temporary restraining order against the Carlson Event Center on Dec. 31, 2020.

The office won a temporary restraining order against The Interchange on Dec. 23, 2020.Â <strong>The court found The Interchange in civil contempt on Jan. 8, 2021, ordered immediate compliance with the executive orders, and imposed a fine of $3,000 a day for each day it remains open in defiance of the court&rsquo;s order.Â </strong></li>
	  <li><strong>Cornerstone CafÃ©:Â </strong>Â The Attorney General&rsquo;s office filed a lawsuit against Cornerstone Cafe in Monticello, Minn., on Dec. 18, 2020, for operating inside on-premises dining in violation of Executive Order 20-99.

	  <li><strong>Alibi Drinkery:</strong>Â Â The Attorney General&rsquo;s office filed a lawsuit against Alibi Drinkery in Lakeville, Minn., on Dec. 17, 2020, for operating inside on-premises dining in violation of Executive Order 20-99. The office won a temporary restraining order against Alibi Drinkery on Dec. 18, 2020, and a temporary injunction on Dec. 31, 2020.Â <strong>The court found Alibi in civil contempt on Jan. 7, 2021, and imposed a fine of $3,000 a day for each day it remains open for indoor, on-premises dining in violation of its temporary injunction.</strong>Â </li>
	  <li><strong>Neighbors on the Rum:</strong>Â Â The Attorney General&rsquo;s office filed a lawsuit against Neighbors on the Rum in Princeton, Minn., on Dec. 17, 2020, for operating inside on-premises dining in violation of Executive Order 20-99. Neighbors on the Rum agreed to comply with the Executive Order after the lawsuit was filed. If it operates in violation of the Executive Order, the office will promptly seek appropriate remedies from the court.</li>
	  <li><strong>Boardwalk Bar and Grill:Â </strong>Â The Attorney General&rsquo;s office filed a lawsuit against Boardwalk Bar and Grill in East Grand Forks, Minn., on Dec. 11, 2020, for operating on-premises dining in violation of Executive Order 20-99. The office won a temporary restraining order the same day and a temporary injunction on Dec. 22, 2020.</li>

	  <li>In addition to the direct enforcement actions brought above under Executive Order 20-99, the Attorney General&rsquo;s office also represents the Minnesota Department of Health in its Dec. 11, 2020, lawsuit against Haven&rsquo;s Garden in Lynd, Minn., for continuing to operate on-premises dining and entertainment in violation of the order. MDH won a temporary restraining order against the establishment on Dec. 12 and a temporary injunction on Dec. 16, 2020. Â </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Attorney General&rsquo;s approach:Â Â Winning voluntary complianceÂ </h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Of the more than 900 establishments and events that the Attorney General&rsquo;s office and its partners in the Departments of Health, Labor and Industry, and Public Safety âÂ as well as local partners like regional health agencies, city and county attorneys, and local law enforcement agencies â have worked with in the past several months, they have succeeded in winning voluntary compliance with the executive orders in all but thirteen instances:Â Â The eleven lawsuits mentioned above andÂ two from earlier in 2020.Â </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Minnesota Department of HealthÂ </h2>
    <h3>Enforcement authorityÂ </h3>
    <p>The Minnesota Department of Health&rsquo;s Environmental Health Division is responsible for regulating restaurants among other facilities. The division uses the following tools, escalating through the list depending on each situation.Â </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Documenting inspection findings and writing orders for correction on inspection reports.Â Â This tool was used as the starting point for businesses violating previous EO requirements such as requiring the use of face coverings by employees or lack of a COVID plan but will not be used for EO 20-99 violations.Â </li>
      <li>10-day letter â Functions as a notice of violation that outlines the alleged violations and warns of the risk of fines up to $10,000 and licensure action.Â </li>
      <li>Cease and Desist â An order for an establishment to close for up to 72 hours to gain compliance with an imminent public health threat. For businesses that continue to violate or indicate to us an intention to violate after the C&amp;D is lifted, MDH can seek an injunction or temporary restraining order to extend the duration of the closure order.Â </li>
      <li>Administrative Penalty Order, monetary penalties and license suspension â Businesses that continue to violate EO requirements may be assessed a monetary penalty to a maximum of $10,000 and the license to operate may be suspended for an indeterminate amount of time. Â </li>
      <li>License revocation â Continued failure to comply may result in escalating the license suspension to a revocation.Â </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Enforcement actions under 20-99, as modified and extended by 20-103Â </h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Mamma Dee&rsquo;s Green Lantern:</strong>Â Â MDH issued a cease-and-desist order and notice of licensure suspension Jan. 8 to Mamma Dee&rsquo;s Green Lantern, in Brainerd, Minn., after determining the facility had violated executive orders designed to protect its employees, customers and community from the COVID-19 pandemic.Â Â Â Â </li>
      <li><strong>Iron Waffle Coffee Company:</strong>Â Â MDH issued a cease-and-desist order Aug. 6 to Iron Waffle Coffee Company, in Nisswa, Minn., after determining the facility had violated executive orders designed to protect its employees, customers and community from the COVID-19 pandemic. When the Iron Waffle continued to violate executive ordersÂ even after it was served with the cease-and-desist order,Â MDH issued an administrative penalty order and a notice of license revocation. MDH won a temporary restraining order Dec. 18.Â </li>
      <li><strong>Mission Tavern:Â Â </strong>MDH issued a cease-and-desist order, administrative penalty order and notice of license suspension Dec. 16 to Mission Tavern, in Merrifield, Minn., after determining the facility had violated executive orders designed to protect its employees, customers and community from the COVID-19 pandemic.
