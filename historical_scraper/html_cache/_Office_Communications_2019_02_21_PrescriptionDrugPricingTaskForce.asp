<p><strong>Press Release</strong></p>   
<h1>Attorney General Ellison starts task force for lowering the cost of pharmaceutical drugs</h1>
 <!--TITLE-->
	<p class="lede">Ellison: Minnesotans are âunited in one simple idea: theyâre entitled to afford their lives â and drug prices are too highâ</p>
 
 
<p><strong>February 21, 2019 (SAINT  PAUL) </strong>â As part of his goal of helping people afford their lives, Minnesota  Attorney General Keith Ellison today announced that his office is forming a  task force for lowering the cost of pharmaceutical drugs. </p>
<p>At a press conference with  legislators, advocates, and Minnesotans who are struggling to afford their  lives and the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs, Ellison said, &ldquo;As the  People&rsquo;s Lawyer, I&rsquo;ve heard from people in every corner of Minnesota that  they&rsquo;re having trouble affording their lives â and the cost of prescription  drugs is a major factor in that. They&rsquo;re all united in one simple idea; they&rsquo;re  entitled to afford their lives â and drug prices are too high.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Attorney General Ellison  stressed some of the known causes of the skyrocketing cost of pharmaceutical  drugs: patents are abused, pricing is not transparent, pharmacy benefit  managers are opaque, and markets are concentrated. As one result, the price of  insulin has increased 1200 percent in 20 years.</p>
<p>To address this problem,  Ellison said that the Advisory Task Force on Lowering Pharmaceutical Drug  Prices will &ldquo;gather in the best thinking&rdquo; in order to come up with  &ldquo;multi-pronged strategies&rdquo; to lower prices. These will include legislation and  litigation, but will not be limited to them. </p>
<p>People can apply to serve on  the 15-member Advisory Task Force on Lowering Pharmaceutical Drug Prices  through March 17 via the Open Appointments process on the <a href="https://commissionsandappointments.sos.state.mn.us/Agency/Details/252">Secretary  of State&rsquo;s website</a>. </p>
<p>Attorney General Ellison was  joined by several people who spoke of their struggles with the high cost of  prescription drugs. </p>
<ul>
  <li>Christy  Kuehn of Lakeland has struggled to afford the cost, and even to understand the  cost, of the insulin on which her husband is dependent. The exact same  medication that costs her more than $2,200 a month to treat her husband&rsquo;s Type  1 diabetes is available in Canada for only $500. Her husband is currently  rationing a six-month supply of insulin over the course of a year. </li>
  <li>Claire  Henn of Saint Paul had to go for three years without prescription medications  to treat her rheumatoid arthritis because the cost rose from $60 to $1,400:  because of that, she is no longer able to cut a peanut-butter sandwich with a  knife. </li>
  <li>Alisa  Clemons of Minneapolis went without medications for lupus and other conditions  for a year that she could not afford when she lost health insurance, then  incurred a $40,000 hospital bill when she almost died as a result.</li>
  <li>Nicole  Smith-Holt of Richfield, who has become a national advocate for lowering the  price of insulin after her 26-year-old, insulin-dependent son Alec died last  year after he rationed his insulin because he could not afford it, pointed out  that insulin is now the 5th-most expensive liquid in the world. As a result, an  estimated one-quarter of insulin-dependent diabetics are rationing their  insulin. At the current rate of increase, she said, &ldquo;Type 1 diabetics cannot to  continue to afford life. It turned out that the cost of my son&rsquo;s life was  $1,300 a month. Pharma is pricing people out of their lives.&rdquo;</li>
  <li>Stella  Whitney-West, CEO of Northpoint Health and Wellness Center in Minneapolis,  spoke of the many clients her clinic sees who work two more part-time jobs but  cannot afford needed pharmaceutical drugs because they lack insurance despite  how much they work. She particularly stressed the social and financial costs  that all Minnesotans pay when people who need drugs to treat mental illness  cannot afford to take them. She said, &ldquo;This is our national emergency. This is  also our national shame.&rdquo; </li>
</ul>

<p>All of them supported  Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s task force and called on people to join it and share  their stories.</p>
<p>Legislators who are working  on different aspects of controlling and bringing down the high cost of  prescription drugs joined Attorney General Ellison at the press conference.  Representative John Lesch of Saint Paul called it &ldquo;morally wrong&rdquo; that people &ldquo;should  lose their lives, or even their livelihoods&rdquo; because of the high cost of  pharmaceutical drugs, particularly ones for which the price has been raised  unconscionably high. Senator Matt Little said, &ldquo;Time after time, the  pharmaceutical manufacturers have proven that they&rsquo;re morally bankrupt.&rdquo; He  said of the many reasons that pharmaceutical companies give for why  pharmaceutical drug prices cannot be lower, &ldquo;we&rsquo;re not buying that.&rdquo; He  concluded, &ldquo;They think we don&rsquo;t see through them, but we do â and we&rsquo;re coming  for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Also joining Attorney General  Ellison were Representative Kelly Morrison, a physician, and Representative  Mike Howard, both of whom are also authoring legislation to make prescription  drug costs transparent and bring them down, including the cost of  insulin.&nbsp; </p>
<p>Four of the 15 seats on the  task force are reserved for two legislators from each party from each house of  the Legislature. </p>
<p>The Advisory Task  force on Lowering Pharmaceutical Drug Prices will begin meeting in April. Its  first order of business will be to set timelines and topics of reports back to  the Attorney General and the people of Minnesota, and to set up locations and  times to hear the stories and testimony of Minnesotans from all walks of life  about the high prices of prescription drugs and what can be done to bring them  down. </p>
<p>Attorney General  Ellison stressed that just as he has been working with legislators of both  parties to support legislation around the cost of prescription drugs, he wants  people of all parties and viewpoints to apply to serve on the Task Force. As  Ms. Clemons said, &ldquo;This is not a  Democratic or Republican issue. This is not a party issue. This is a people  issue.&rdquo;</p>
