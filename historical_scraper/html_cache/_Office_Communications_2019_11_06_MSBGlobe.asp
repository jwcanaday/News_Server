<h1>
Attorney General Ellisonâs office notches big victory for defrauded MSB/Globe students
</h1>
	<p class="lede">Minnesota Supreme Court allows AGâs office to obtain tuition refunds for more than 1,300 low-income students of MSB/Globe criminal-justice program â more than $33 million in restitution now possible
</p>
	<p class="lede">Court also affirms AGâs authority to seek restitution for all Minnesotans harmed by fraud </p>
	
	
	<p align="left"><strong>November 6,&nbsp;2019&nbsp;(SAINT  PAUL)</strong> â The office  of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison won a big victory today when the <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Standard%20Opinions/OPA171740-110619.pdf">Minnesota Supreme Court ruled</a> that the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office  can pursue tuition refunds for students fraudulently enrolled in the Minnesota  School of Business (MSB) and Globe University&rsquo;s (Globe) so-called  &ldquo;criminal-justice&rdquo; program. </p>
    <p align="left">Had the Supreme Court ruled against the Attorney  General today, only the 15 students who testified in court against MSB and  Globe would have been eligible for tuition refunds, for a total of $375,000.  Because of the Attorney General&rsquo;s win today, all former students of MSB and  Globe&rsquo;s criminal-justice program since 2009 â 1,336 of them â will be eligible  to make a claim for refunds totaling $33.7 million. </p>
    <p align="left">During the four-week trial in the case, the Attorney  General&rsquo;s Office proved that MSB and Globe targeted students from low-income  families with materials that fraudulently claimed that their so-called  &ldquo;criminal-justice&rdquo; program would qualify them for jobs as police and probation  officers, when that was not the case. The trial court stated that &ldquo;the  pervasiveness of [MSB and Globe&rsquo;s] false and deceptive practices&rdquo; was proven  through &ldquo;testimony of several former employeesâ¦, as well as testimony of [MSB  and Globe&rsquo;s] managers, â¦solicitations and mass advertising, and â¦internal  training materials.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="left">In addition, the Supreme Court broadly affirmed the  Attorney General&rsquo;s legal authority to pursue restitution and compensation for  all Minnesotans harmed by &ldquo;a pattern and practice of fraudulent conduct.&rdquo;&nbsp; </p>
    <p align="left">&ldquo;Minnesotans of all backgrounds just want to be able to  afford their lives. Today&rsquo;s ruling affirms my office&rsquo;s authority to get money  back for Minnesotans when they&rsquo;re harmed by fraud â in this case, low-income  students who were falsely told that they could become Minnesota police or  probation officers by enrolling in a program that cost upwards of $70,000,&rdquo;  Attorney General Ellison said. &ldquo;These students were convinced to take out  costly student loans, expend hard-earned GI Bill benefits, and spend their  savings to attend a fraudulent program because the schools misrepresented to  them that it was a way to make a better life for them and their families, when  the schools knew it wasn&rsquo;t. Instead, they were left with a degree they can&rsquo;t  use or credits they can&rsquo;t transfer â and tens of thousands of dollars in debt.  I&rsquo;m pleased the Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed that my office can restore  those losses to victims.&rdquo;</p>
    <p align="left">Writing for the Supreme Court&rsquo;s 5-2 majority, <a href="http://www.mncourts.gov/mncourtsgov/media/Appellate/Supreme%20Court/Standard%20Opinions/OPA171740-110619.pdf">Justice Paul Thissen wrote</a>:</p>
    <p align="left">The Attorney General seeks equitable  restitution on behalf of all the Schools&rsquo; criminal justice students; not money  damages for each individual student. Equitable restitution, unlike money  damages, is intended to force a wrongdoer to divest money improperly gained at  the expense of another party. It is aimed as much (or more) at preventing the  wrongdoer from profiting from its misdeeds as it is to make the injured party  whole. (p. 23)</p>
    <p align="left">The Attorney General seeks to divest  the Schools of gains that they reaped as a result of their violations of the <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.69">MCFA [Minnesota Consumer Fraud Act]</a> and then (rather than holding those  proceeds for the State) distribute the proceeds to injured consumersâa power we  interpret as within the Attorney General&rsquo;s <em>parens patriae</em> authority and  granted to the Attorney General in <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/8.31">Minn. Stat. Â§ 8.31</a>. (p. 24)</p>
    <h2 align="left">Background</h2>
    <p align="left">In 2014, the Minnesota Attorney General&rsquo;s Office  brought an enforcement action against MSB and Globe after an investigation  uncovered rampant fraudulent and illegal practices used to enroll students and  obtain tens of thousands of dollars in federal financial aid.&nbsp; Many  students who enrolled at the for-profit colleges reported that they found  themselves saddled with tens of thousands of dollars in debt without the  ability to get jobs in their chosen fields. MSB and Globe maintained campuses  in Blaine, Brooklyn Center, Elk River, Lakeville, Minneapolis, Moorhead,  Plymouth, Richfield, Rochester, Shakopee, and Woodbury. </p>
    <p align="left">In 2016, a Hennepin County District Court found that  MSB and Globe engaged in consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices by  misrepresenting the job opportunities available to their criminal justice  graduates. The District Court then issued an order awarding an injunction,  penalties, and restitution to victimized students. The court fashioned a  process for criminal-justice students enrolled in the program since 2009 who  were misled about their ability to become a Minnesota police officer or  probation officer to obtain refunds of tuition, fees, and student loan interest  paid or accrued. The Minnesota Supreme Court today rejected the schools&rsquo; appeal  and attempt to prevent students from receiving restitution and upheld the lower  court&rsquo;s order. </p>
    <h2 align="left">Resources for affected students</h2>
    <p align="left">If you believe you are a criminal-justice student who  is eligible to submit a claim for restitution, have questions about the  restitution process on appeal, or have any other questions about the Attorney  General&rsquo;s lawsuit, you can contact the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office at (651)  296-3353 (Metro area) or (800) 657-3787 (Greater Minnesota). If you believe you  are potentially eligible for restitution and your contact information has  recently changed, please contact the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office immediately.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Borrower&rsquo;s Defense to Repayment of  Federal Student Loans. </h3>
    <p align="left">Federal  law provides that students may apply to the U.S. Department of Education for  &ldquo;borrower defense&rdquo; to repayment on their federal student loans. Students may be  eligible to submit a borrower-defense claim if their school committed fraud  against them, misrepresented its services to them, or otherwise violated state  law. Students interested in determining if they are eligible to submit a  borrower-defense claim should visit the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s <a href="https://studentaid.ed.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense">website </a>for more information. Students can also call the U.S. Department of  Education&rsquo;s borrower defense hotline (855) 279-6207 or send an email to: <a href="mailto:borrowerdefense@ed.gov">borrowerdefense@ed.gov</a>.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Defense to Repayment of Private  Student Loans.&nbsp; </h3>
    <p align="left">A  federal regulation called the &ldquo;Holder Rule&rdquo; allows consumers to (in some cases)  assert defenses to a creditor&rsquo;s collection of money based on the seller&rsquo;s false  representations. The Federal Trade Commission has stated that private student  loans fall within the scope of the Holder Rule. Accordingly, you may be able to  cancel existing debt from your private student loans if your school  fraudulently induced you to enroll and had some relationship with the private  lender that issued your loans. You may wish to consult our flyer, <a href="/Consumer/Publications/HolderRule.asp">The  Holder Rule: When You Take Out a Loan and the Product is Defective or  Fraudulent</a> for more information. Our Office cannot give you legal advice or  tell you whether the Holder Rule may apply to your situation. As a result, you  may wish to consult an attorney about whether the Holder Rule may apply to your  situation and how to assert it. You may wish to consult our publication, <a href="/Consumer/Publications/HiringAnAttorney.asp">Hiring an  Attorney</a>, for guidance in looking for an attorney.</p>
    <h3 align="left">Discharge of Federal Student Loans  Due to the Closure of MSB and Globe. </h3>
    <p align="left">Students  affected by closure may wish to apply for &ldquo;closed school discharge&rdquo; related to  loans they took out to attend MSB and Globe. Under federal law, enrolled  students at schools that close and students who have withdrawn within 120 days  of a school&rsquo;s closure may be eligible to receive a 100% discharge of their  federal student loans from the U.S. Department of Education.</p>
    <p align="left">Please note, however, that students are generally not  eligible for this discharge if they: (1) withdrew more than 120 days before a  school&rsquo;s closure; (2) they are completing their program through a teach-out  agreement with the closed school, or are transferring the credits they earned  at the closed school to a comparable program at another institution; or (3)  have completed all the coursework for their program.&nbsp; After a <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/08/08_MSBGlobeLoans.asp">request  and advocacy by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office</a>, the U.S. Secretary of  Education expanded the group of MSB and Globe students eligible for  closed-school discharge to include anyone who attended and withdrew on  September 8, 2016 and after (the date the district court issued its findings of  fraud in the Attorney General&rsquo;s case).
