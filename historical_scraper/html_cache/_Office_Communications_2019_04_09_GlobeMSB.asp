<h1>
Information regarding the Attorney Generalâs lawsuit against the Minnesota School of Business (âMSBâ) and Globe University (âGlobeâ)
</h1>


 
 
  <p align="left">The Minnesota Attorney General&rsquo;s Office has led  the fight for former students who were defrauded by the so-called  &ldquo;criminal-justice&rdquo; degree programs at Minnesota School of Business (&ldquo;MSB&rdquo;) and  Globe University (&ldquo;Globe&rsquo;) and for students who were charged illegal rates of  interest on loans that the schools offered. Minnesota courts have agreed: they  have held that Minnesota School of Business (&ldquo;MSB&rdquo;) and Globe University  (&ldquo;Globe&rsquo;) engaged in fraud in the marketing and recruitment of students into  the schools&rsquo; &ldquo;criminal-justice&rdquo; program between 2009 and 2016. The Attorney  General&rsquo;s Office also secured an order holding that MSB and Globe&rsquo;s  institutional lending programs violated Minnesota law and interest-rate caps. </p>
  <p align="left">Following the schools&rsquo; filings for bankruptcy,  the Office won significant debt relief and restitution for criminal-justice  students. The Office won cancellation  and full refunds for payments that students made on the schools&rsquo; illegal  institutional loans. Students otherwise affected by fraud or misconduct  associated with their enrollment at MSB or Globe, or who were enrolled at the  schools when their closure was announced, may be eligible to apply for  forgiveness of their federal student loans. </p>
  <p align="left">This page includes background information about  the lawsuit, the history of the litigation and resolution of the case, and  other information for students who may have been affected.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Students Enrolled in the Criminal-Justice Program</h2>
  <p align="left">The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office began  investigating MSB and Globe in 2013. In 2014, the Office sued the schools,  alleging consumer fraud and illegal lending practices. On September 8, 2016,  the Hennepin County District Court issued an order finding MSB and Globe  engaged in consumer fraud and deceptive trade practices by misrepresenting the  job opportunities available to their criminal-justice graduates. In 2017, the  Court issued an Order awarding an injunction, penalties, and restitution. The  order for restitution set up a process for defrauded criminal-justice students  enrolled in the program from 2009 to 2016 to claim restitution--which included  refunds for tuition paid, other student expenses or fees paid, and interest  paid or incurred for taking out a student loan to pay those costs. The process,  however, was delayed by appeals and the schools&rsquo; bankruptcy filing. </p>
  <p align="left">The restitution process finally began in 2020.  Pursuant to that process, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office sent out and collected  notice and claim forms from eligible former students who attended MSB and  Globe&rsquo;s &ldquo;criminal justice&rdquo; program. The Office ended up receiving 920 claim forms  from criminal-justice students, though the vast majority of those claims were  subject to objections by the schools&rsquo; owners. After receiving and responding to  those objections, the Office began negotiating a resolution of all issues  related to the restitution claims process and to secure maximum relief for  defrauded students.</p>
  <p align="left">In March 2021, the Office secured commitments  from the schools and the U.S. Department of Education that call for (1)  complete discharge of all federal student loan debt related to claimants&rsquo; enrollment  in the criminal-justice program and (2) additional cash relief of $15.8 million  for eligible claimants.&nbsp; The agreement was filed in bankruptcy court and  involved several parties, including the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the trustee  appointed to oversee MSB and Globe, the schools&rsquo; owners, and the U.S.  Department of Education. Relief for criminal-justice students under the  agreement includes: Â </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Cancellation of 100% of  federal student loans taken out to attend the criminal-justice program for all  students who filed restitution claims or testified at trial. This will result  in $23.6 million in financial relief overall and applies to all 920 claimants.</li>
    <li>$12.3 million in  additional cash payments to eligible claimants, which provides compensation for  amounts paid by eligible students from other sources to attend the criminal-justice  program (e.g., payments from private loans, out-of-pocket payments, GI Bill  payments, etc.) and payments made towards forgiven federal student loans.&nbsp; </li>
  </ul>
  <p align="left">The agreement also provides for a payment to the  U.S. Department of Education of $7 million. </p>
  <p align="left">The agreement was confirmed by the U.S.  Department of Education and approved by the bankruptcy court in the summer of  2021. After the funding for payments was fully in place, the U.S. Department of  Education was able to complete the loan discharge process in late September  2021. Payments then began to be distributed on September 30, 2021. Pursuant to  a detailed plan approved by the bankruptcy court, the trustee for MSB/Globe is  acting as &ldquo;Disbursing Agent&rdquo; and will distribute checks to criminal-justice  students. The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office will assist in identifying the location  of eligible criminal-justice students for re-issuance of checks that are  returned or remain uncashed. </p>
  <p align="left">As explained above, eligible criminal-justice students will have their federal student loans used to attend the criminal-justice program forgiven. <a href="https://studentaid.gov/announcements-events/msb-globe" target="_blank">According to the U.S. Department of Education</a>, loan discharges are currently being processed. Loans eligible for forgiveness will not return to repayment before forgiveness is issued. The Department will update the credit bureaus automatically to reflect the forgiven loans.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Relief for Institutional Loan Borrowers </h2>
  <p align="left">This Office also challenged the legality of  certain loans issued by the schoolsâcalled Educational Opportunities (&ldquo;EdOp&rdquo;)  and Student Access (&ldquo;StA&rdquo;) loansâthat were made to MSB/Globe students between  2009 and 2016. The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office found, and the courts ruled, that  the loans were illegal because MSB and Globe were unlicensed and charged  interest rates higher than allowed by Minnesota law. </p>
  <p align="left">Financial relief ordered  by the courts was in stages. The  Hennepin County District Court at first limited refunds to&nbsp;interest&nbsp;paid by student-borrowers on illegal loansâtotaling $3.7  million. The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office thus received payment for this amount in  2018 and distributed nearly all eligible refunds to institutional loan  borrowers. The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office also appealed the district court&rsquo;s  decision, arguing it erred by failing to allow full refunds of all principal  and interest paid on the illegal loans. The appellate court agreed, and an  additional $3.5 million in restitution related to paid principal was later ordered.  However, because the later order for additional restitution did not come until  after the schools filed for bankruptcy, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office was  unable to collect this restitution until the resolution of the bankruptcy. </p>
  <p align="left">As part of the agreement announced in March 2021,  the schools and owners agreed to pay funds to allow for theÂ  principal paid on the illegal loans to be  fully refunded to affected students. The owners of MSB/Globe met their funding  obligations, and the trustee will be able to begin the process of distributing  restitution related to principal paid on institutional loans in October 2021. Any  remaining restitution owed to students related interest payments will also be  subject to final distribution in October 2021. </p>
  <h2 align="left">Students Enrolled During MSB/Globe&rsquo;s Closure</h2>
  <p align="left">There is also student-loan relief available for  students who were attending the schools when the Court made its findings of  fraud and the schools were notified that they would lose authorization to  continue operating as a higher education institution in Minnesota. Under  federal law, students at schools that close and students who have withdrawn  within 120 days of a school&rsquo;s closure may be eligible to receive a 100%  discharge of their federal student loans from the U.S. Department of Education.  After a request and advocacy by the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office, the U.S.  Secretary of Education expanded the group of MSB and Globe students eligible  for closed-school discharge to include anyone who attended and withdrew on  September 8, 2016, and after.</p>
  <p align="left">Please note, however, that students are  generally not eligible for this discharge if they completed their program  through a teach-out agreement with the closed school, transferred the credits  they earned at the closed school to a comparable program at another institution,  or completed all the coursework for their program.</p>
  <p align="left">If you have questions about the process for  closed school discharge, you should consult the Department of Education&rsquo;s&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/closed-school">website</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/sa/sites/default/files/msb-mn.pdf">fact sheet</a>&nbsp;for MSB and Globe students.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Students Affected by Other Fraud or Misconduct </h2>
  <p align="left">If you believe you were defrauded or enrolled at  MSB/Globe based on false statements but were not part of the criminal-justice  program, you may still apply for cancellation of your federal student loans. Federal  law provides that students may apply to the U.S. Department of Education for  &ldquo;borrower defense&rdquo; to repayment on their federal student loans. Students may be  eligible to submit a borrower-defense claim if their school committed fraud  against them, misrepresented its services to them, or otherwise violated state  law. </p>
  <p align="left">Students interested in determining if they are  eligible to submit a borrower-defense claim should visit the&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/sa/repay-loans/forgiveness-cancellation/borrower-defense" target="_blank">U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s  website</a>&nbsp;for more  information. Students can also call the U.S. Department of Education&rsquo;s borrower  defense hotline (855) 279-6207 or send an email to:&nbsp;<a href="mailto:borrowerdefense@ed.gov">borrowerdefense@ed.gov</a>.</p>
  <h2 align="left">Other Administrative Actions Taken Against MSB/Globe</h2>
  <h3 align="left">Minnesota Office of Higher Education</h3>
  <p align="left">On September 15, 2016, the Minnesota Office of  Higher Education (&ldquo;OHE&rdquo;) issued an order revoking MSB and Globe&rsquo;s registration  to operate as higher-education institutions in Minnesota. OHE is a separate  agency from the Minnesota Attorney General&rsquo;s Office and is acting under laws it  is authorized to enforce. More information about OHE&rsquo;s actions is available on  its webpage,&nbsp;<a href="http://www.ohe.state.mn.us/mPg.cfm?pageID=2213" target="_blank">Information for Globe University and Minnesota  School of Business Students.</a> </p>
  <h3 align="left">U.S. Department of Education</h3>
  <p align="left">The U.S. Department of Education notified the  schools that, effective December 31, 2016, all of MSB and Globe&rsquo;s locations  would no longer be eligible to participate in federal student financial aid  programs because the schools have been judicially determined to have committed  fraud by the Hennepin County District Court and made substantial  misrepresentations about the careers available to graduates of their criminal  justice program and the transferability of their credits.&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/sa/about/announcements/msb-globe" target="_blank">View the Department&rsquo;s  announcement</a>&nbsp;and the  notifications it sent the schools. The Department&rsquo;s website indicates that it  will be posting additional information for affected students of the schools at  the following address:&nbsp;<a href="https://studentaid.gov/sa/" target="_blank">https://studentaid.gov/sa/</a>&nbsp;as the situation develops.</p>
  <h3 align="left">Contacting the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office</h3>
  <p align="left">If you have questions about the  Attorney General&rsquo;s lawsuit, you can contact the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office at  (651) 296-3353 (Twin Cities Calling Area) or (800) 657-3787 (Outside the Twin  Cities). If you believe you are potentially eligible for restitution and your  contact information has recently changed, please contact the Attorney General&rsquo;s  Office immediately.</p>
