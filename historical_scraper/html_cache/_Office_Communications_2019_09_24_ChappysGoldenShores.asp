<h1>
Attorney General Ellisonâs office files 76 maltreatment, fraud, and obstruction charges against owner, managers, and employees of assisted-living facility
</h1>
	<p class="lede">Manslaughter among charges brought against former owner of Chappyâs Golden Shores in Hill City, who faces 25 charges alone </p>
	
	
	<p align="left"><strong>September 24,&nbsp;2019&nbsp;(SAINT  PAUL)</strong> â Yesterday,  the office of Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison charged 10 people with a  collective 76 counts of manslaughter, assault, neglect, racketeering, theft,  operating an comprehensive home-care facility without a license, concealing the  proceeds of these crimes, perjury, and obstructing the State&rsquo;s criminal  investigation. They are the former owner, managers, and employees of Chappy&rsquo;s  Golden Shores, a now-closed assisted-living facility in Hill City.</p>
    <p align="left"><a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/09/TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf">Chappy&rsquo;s former owner Theresa Lee  Olson alone faces 25 charges</a>,  including one count of manslaughter for her conduct in the death of Chappy&rsquo;s  resident R.M. </p>
    <p align="left">In addition to Theresa Olson, the defendants are  Benjiman Howard Swanson, with whom Olson shares an infant child; Olson&rsquo;s sister  Lisa Michelle Anderson; Olson&rsquo;s daughter Monika Lynn Olson; Alexcis Elizabeth  Hines; Christina Michelle Meagher; Kristin Marie Davis; and Susan Joyce Ellis,  all of Hill City; and Olson&rsquo;s niece Janiece Freelove Mattson-Olson and Georgia  Louise Salomonson, both of Grand Rapids. </p>
    <p align="left">The defendants have all been charged in Aitkin County  District Court. The charges  contained in the complaints are accusations; the defendants are presumed  innocent unless and until proven guilty.</p>
    <p align="left">&ldquo;Every Minnesotan deserves to live with dignity and  respect. This does not exclude the sick and the vulnerable â it includes  everyone. This means that every Minnesotan who needs care deserves care, not  abuse,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison said. &ldquo;My office is holding these defendants  accountable for what we believe we can prove is systematic, intolerable abuse  and neglect that in one case led to death, not to mention widespread fraud,  theft, and other charges that hurt everyone. </p>
    <p align="left">&ldquo;We are aggressively prosecuting this case. Whenever my  office has jurisdiction, we will be aggressive in prosecuting criminal charges  like it in order to protect all Minnesotans,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison  concluded. </p>
    <p align="left">The criminal case is being prosecuted by the Attorney  General&rsquo;s office both because it was referred to the Office by the Aitkin  County Attorney, and because the Office has original criminal jurisdiction over  cases of Medicaid fraud. </p>
    <p align="left">In early 2019, the Attorney General&rsquo;s Office opened a  criminal investigation into Chappy&rsquo;s Golden Shores, an assisted-living facility  located in Hill City, Minnesota, upon referral from the Aitkin County  Attorney&rsquo;s Office. As detailed in the <a href="http://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/09/TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf">criminal complaint against Theresa  Olson</a>,  investigators reviewed over 1 million pages of documentary and digital evidence  and conducted dozens of interviews of Chappy&rsquo;s residents and employees, medical  professionals, social workers, guardians, and other witnesses. They found the  following: </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Olson  and certain Chappy&rsquo;s employees subjected multiple residents to neglect by  failing to provide them with proper health care, supervision, food or shelter.  For instance, R.M., a 72-year-old Marine Corps veteran who resided at Chappy&rsquo;s  beginning October 2017, died in October 2018 of septic shock, an untreated  urinary tract infection, and dysphasia and pneumonia complications which  resulted from improper medical care and neglect. The medical providers who  treated R.M. just before his death described R.M.&rsquo;s catheter as filthy and characterized  his 25 x 25 cm pressure sore as &ldquo;[one of] the worst [they] had ever seen,&rdquo; and  the result of &ldquo;utter, complete neglect.&rdquo;&nbsp; (Complaint pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=25">25-29</a>)</li>
      <li>From  February 2017 to February 2019, Chappy&rsquo;s owner Theresa Lee Olson, with the  assistance of the facility&rsquo;s manager and several employees, bilked the State of  Minnesota&rsquo;s Medicaid program of over $2.1 million by billing for health care  services that did not occur or were not covered by the Medicaid program  because: </li>
		<ol class="LIAlpha">
        <li>Chappy&rsquo;s had no registered nurse on  staff to assess and oversee the services provided to Chappy&rsquo;s residents, some  of whom required around the clock care.&nbsp; To hide this fact, the defendants  submitted fraudulent licensing applications using the identity of a registered  nurse who no longer worked at Chappy&rsquo;s and forged the nurse&rsquo;s signature on  medical records, including the records of resident R.M. who died from neglect.  (Complaint, pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=15">15-17</a>, <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=36">36</a>)</li>
        <li>Chappy&rsquo;s housed residents at  unlicensed, unapproved facilities. Conditions at one of the facilities included  &ldquo;holes in the closet leading to the exterior of the home, a broken window and  door, visible water damage, and rodent nests and feces.&rdquo; (Complaint pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=17">17-18</a>,  <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=23">23-24</a>, <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=32">32</a>)</li>
        <li>Chappy&rsquo;s billed for services  provided by home health aides who had not passed required background checks.  Some of the aides had convictions that would have disqualified them from  providing direct care to vulnerable adults, such as assault and electronic  solicitation of a minor. To conceal this from the State, Chappy&rsquo;s listed these  aides as &ldquo;maintenance&rdquo; or &ldquo;custodians&rdquo; and made sure they were not present for  State licensing reviews. For instance, on November 6, 2018, defendant Monika  Olson messaged aide B.W.: &ldquo;[S]tate is in the house and will be at time of night  shift as well. Please come in and go directly to the basement so they don&rsquo;t see  you until they are gone.&rdquo; B.W. had not undergone a background study and would  not have passed a background study due to prior felony burglary and domestic  assault convictions. (Complaint pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=17">17-20</a>, <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=38">38</a>)&nbsp; </li>
        <li>Chappy&rsquo;s billed for services that  could not have occurred as the residents were not at Chappy&rsquo;s on the dates  billed. For instance, Chappy&rsquo;s billed and received Medicaid funds for services  resident T.F. could not have received because according to Chappy&rsquo;s own  records, T.F. was hospitalized at the time. (Complaint pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=20">20-21</a>)&nbsp; </li>
      </ol>
	<li>Shortly after Chappy&rsquo;s license was  suspended by the Minnesota Department of Health (MDH) due to substantiated  allegations of abuse and neglect, Olson sold Chappy&rsquo;s to her daughter, Monika  Lynn Olson, for $1. The Olsons renamed the facility &ldquo;Mont Royal&rdquo; and attempted  to obtain licensure from MDH.&nbsp; When MDH rejected Mont Royal&rsquo;s license  applications, the Olsons and other employees continued to house former Chappy&rsquo;s  residents and provide them with unlicensed health care services. (Complaint pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=22">22-24</a>)</li>
      <li>The defendants engaged in an  extensive and coordinated effort to conceal evidence of fraud and maltreatment,  falsify records in response to State investigations and convince potential  witnesses to provide false or misleading answers to State investigators. A  notebook seized during a search warrant at Olson&rsquo;s home included a section  titled &ldquo;debunk [K.P.]&rdquo; and a list of reasons that 911 was not called when  neglect victim K.P. fell on ice at Chappy&rsquo;s and broke her hip. A whiteboard  seized from Chappy&rsquo;s appeared to be a script for&nbsp; employees to follow when  answering State investigators&rsquo; questions about neglect victim E.W. (Complaint  pp. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=30">30-32</a>, <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=35">35-38</a>)</li>
      <li>After  MDH began investigating Chappy&rsquo;s, Olson and her husband withdrew over $1.7  million from Chappy&rsquo;s bank account. When Chappy&rsquo;s comprehensive home-care  license was suspended by MDH, Olson sold two of Chappy&rsquo;s buildings to  co-defendants Monika Lynn Olson and Benjiman Howard Swanson for $1. (Complaint  p. <a href="TheresaOlson_Complaint.pdf#page=38">38</a>)&nbsp;&nbsp; </li>
