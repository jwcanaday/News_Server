Task force to meet on April 23, produce report and action plan by start of 2020 legislative session
</p>
 
 
    <p><strong>April 3, 2019 (Saint Paul) </strong>â<strong> </strong>Minnesota Attorney General Keith  Ellison today announced the 15 members of his <a href="/Office/Communications/2019/02/21_PrescriptionDrugPricingTaskForce.asp">Advisory Task Force  on Lowering Pharmaceutical Drug Prices</a>. They include medical practitioners,  representatives of labor and industry, four legislators from each house and  each party, and the executive director of the Board of Pharmacy.</p>
    <p>Attorney General Ellison has charged the task  force with gathering in the best thinking in order to understand why the prices  of prescription drugs are so high â in some cases, unconscionably high â and  come up with multi-pronged strategies to lower prices. These will include  legislative, legal, regulatory, and community-based strategies.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Exorbitant drug prices are not only breaking  family budgets, they are ending lives,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison said.  &ldquo;Minnesotans must have meaningful answers to drug-price affordability. I want  to thank conscientious citizens for stepping forward to serve on the task  force. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;I also want to thank everyone who applied to  serve. We had more than 100 applicants to choose from for just 15 spots, and  all would make outstanding task force members. We will call on you as well,&rdquo;  Attorney General Ellison concluded.</p>
    <p>The task force will hold its first monthly  meeting on April&nbsp;23, from 5:30-7:30&nbsp;p.m. in Room&nbsp;316 of the  State Capitol. Attorney General Ellison and members of the task force will hold  a media availability immediately beforehand. The task force will produce a  report within nine months, before the start of the 2020 legislative session,  and will continue its work for up to two years.</p>
    <p>The members of the task force were chosen from  among 112 people who applied through the Secretary of State&rsquo;s <a href="https://commissionsandappointments.sos.state.mn.us/Agency/Details/252">Open Appointments</a> process. Nicole Smith-Holt will serve as a co-chair of the task force. The  members of the task force are: </p>

Her husband is currently rationing a six-month supply of  insulin over the course of a year. <strong></strong></p>
