<h1>
State sues JUUL for deceptive marketing targeting youth
</h1>

	<p class="lede">AG Ellison announces lawsuit with Gov. Walz as Minnesota loses 10 years of progress in fighting youth tobacco use
</p>
	<p class="lede">JUUL addicts youth by deceiving them about nicotine content, following Big Tobacco marketing playbook</p>
	
	
	<p><strong>December 4, 2019 (SAINT  PAUL)</strong> â Minnesota Attorney General  Keith Ellison, along with Governor Tim Walz and Lieutenant Governor Peggy  Flanagan, today announced that the State of Minnesota is suing e-cigarette  manufacturer JUUL Labs, Inc. The <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/Documents/20191204_JUULComplaint.pdf">lawsuit</a>,  filed in Hennepin County District Court, alleges among other counts that JUUL  has violated multiple state consumer-protection laws, breached its duty of  reasonable care, and created a public nuisance. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;My job is to protect  Minnesotans from deceptive, fraudulent, and unlawful practices, and to protect  their health and safety. It&rsquo;s especially important for me to protect our young  folks from deception and harm. I&rsquo;m bringing a lawsuit against JUUL today  because it has created a public nuisance that is centered around deceiving,  addicting, and harming our young people,&rdquo; said Attorney General Ellison.</p>
    <p>&ldquo;In Minnesota, we have a  special duty to take on this fight,&rdquo; Attorney General Ellison added. &ldquo;Twenty  years ago, we led the nation in taking on Big Tobacco. Now JUUL has stepped in  to deceive consumers just like Big Tobacco did and has taken it to a whole new  level. We&rsquo;re not going to stand by while this company tries to deceive and  addict a whole new generation of our youth.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;Students across the state  tell me they feel preyed upon by JUUL,&rdquo; said Governor Tim Walz. &ldquo;As a father of  two teenagers and Governor of Minnesota, I&rsquo;m saying enough is enough. We&rsquo;re  going to hold JUUL accountable for the vaping epidemic they started in  Minnesota.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>&ldquo;As the mom of a child with  asthma, I think about a future where my daughter and kids in our community will  be targeted by JUUL&rsquo;s deceptive marketing practices if we don&rsquo;t act now,&rdquo; said  Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan. &ldquo;The rate of eighth graders using  e-cigarettes has doubled in just three years. I&rsquo;m proud to join the Attorney  General in this fight and work to make sure eighth graders aren&rsquo;t being taken  advantage of by Big Tobacco.&rdquo;</p>
    <p>The complaint that Attorney General  Ellison filed today describes how JUUL developed products with higher, more  potent, and more addictive doses of nicotine than conventional cigarettes and  other e-cigarettes â then not only failed to disclose that to its customers,  but represented that its products are a safe alternative to cigarettes. </p>
    <p>The complaint also describes  in detail how JUUL developed sleek-looking products and sweet, popular flavors  that were designed to appeal to youth, and how its vast, targeted, and highly  effective youth-oriented marketing campaign closely follows the Big Tobacco  marketing playbook of decades past in deceptively luring young people into  using and becoming addicted to its products. Indeed, JUUL&rsquo;s co-founder has  stated that even before JUUL launched its products, they studied Big Tobacco&rsquo;s  marketing strategies in detail.</p>
    <p>In 2017, the Minnesota  Department of Health reported than nearly 90 percent of Minnesota teens had  seen at least one advertisement for vaping in the last 30 days. </p>
    <p>The complaint also asserts  that JUUL was negligent in its duty to correctly verify its customers&rsquo; ages, as  required by Minnesota law, and deliberately turned a blind eye to the fact that  its controls were not working and underage Minnesotans were purchasing their  products.</p>
    <p>In the wake of this alleged  deceptive, fraudulent, and unlawful behavior by JUUL â which controls 75  percent of the e-cigarette market â tobacco use has risen dramatically among  Minnesota youth. </p>
    <ul>
      <li>In  October 2019, MDH reported that in the last three years, the percentage of 11th  graders who have vaped in the last 30 days has grown more than 50 percent, the  percentage of 9th graders has grown 75 percent, and the percentage  of 8th graders has grown nearly 100 percent. </li>
      <li>This  means that that in the last 30 days, 11 percent of all Minnesota 8th-graders  have vaped, 16-percent of 9th-graders have vaped, and 26 percent of  11th-graders have vaped.</li>
      <li>75  percent of Minnesota youth who use e-cigarettes had never smoked a cigarette  before.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>This rapid growth has wiped  out the last 10 years&rsquo; worth of progress that Minnesota made in fighting youth  tobacco use. This reversal has taken place quickly: from 2000 to 2017, the  prevalence of smoking in high school decreased 70 percent. The year 2017 was  the first in nearly two decades that saw an increase in tobacco use among high  school students.</p>
    <p>The growth is taking place  despite the known harms of vaping. E-cigarettes have been shown not only to be  highly addictive, but to have the potential to cause cancer, seizures,  breathing problems, and DNA damage. Young people are at a higher risk of  nicotine addiction than adults because their brains are not fully formed until  age 25. Studies also show that adolescent tobacco use is associated with the  risk of developing major mental-health disorders.</p>
    <p>Yet against the backdrop of  JUUL&rsquo;s aggressive youth-marketing campaigns, 75 percent of Minnesota 11th-graders  say they think vaping is not dangerous.</p>
    <p>JUUL&rsquo;s rise to dominance in  the e-cigarette market, especially among youth, has been as swift as  Minnesota&rsquo;s reversal in fighting youth tobacco use. From a small, obscure  start-up in 2015, JUUL grew to a value of $38 billion in 2019. In just one  year, from 2017 to 2018, its revenues grew 800 percent. Its share of the  e-cigarette market grew in just two years from one-quarter of the market in  2017 to three-quarters of the market in 2019. </p>
    <p>Big Tobacco has recognized  this growth. In December 2018, tobacco giant Altria â the owner of Philip  Morris and other major cigarette brands â bought a 35 percent stake in JUUL for  nearly $13 billion.</p>
    <p>The complaint that Attorney  General Ellison filed today on behalf of the State of Minnesota alleges that  JUUL has committed: <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.69">consumer fraud</a>; <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325D.44">deceptive trade practices</a>; <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325D.13">unlawful trade practices</a>; <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/325F.67">false statement in advertisement</a>; <a href="https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/cite/609.74">public nuisance</a>;  negligence and negligence per se; and unjust enrichment. </p>
    <p>To remedy this behavior, the  State asks the court to:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Declare  JUUL is responsible for creating a public nuisance in Minnesota and violating  its consumer protection statutes;</li>
      <li>Order  JUUL to permanently stop its deceptive conduct in Minnesota, including  marketing to youth;</li>
      <li>Order  JUUL to fund a corrective public education campaign in Minnesota about the  dangers of youth vaping;</li>
      <li>Order  JUUL to fund clinical vaping cessation programs in Minnesota, including  programs appropriate for youth;</li>
      <li>Order  JUUL to take affirmative steps to prevent the sale of its products to children;</li>
      <li>Order  JUUL to disclose all its research relating to vaping and health;</li>
      <li>Award  monetary relief for the great harm and injury JUUL has caused in Minnesota; </li>
      <li>Award  civil penalties, investigatory fees, expert witness fees, and attorneys&rsquo; fees  for violations of Minnesota&rsquo;s consumer-protection laws;</li>
      <li>Reimburse  Minnesota for all its expenditures, since JUUL&rsquo;s inception, related to  controlling e-cigarette use among Minnesota&rsquo;s youth; and</li>
      <li>Order  JUUL to disgorge all payments it received from its unlawful conduct.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office  has hired two firms, Robins Kaplan LLP and Zimmerman Reed LLP, as outside  counsel for this lawsuit. The Attorney General&rsquo;s Office submitted this  special-attorney appointment for the <a href="https://www.lcc.leg.mn/lac/">Legislative  Advisory Commission</a> for review and recommendation on  October&nbsp;21,&nbsp;2019. Three members of the Commission made a  recommendation in favor of the contract and three members made no  recommendation. After the 20-day review period passed, the Attorney General&rsquo;s  Office proceeded with hiring the firms.</p>
    <p>A copy of the complaint is  available on <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2019/Documents/20191204_JUULComplaint.pdf">Attorney  General Ellison&rsquo;s website</a>.
