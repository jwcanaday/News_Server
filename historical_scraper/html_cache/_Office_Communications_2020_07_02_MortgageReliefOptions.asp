<h1>AG Ellison, Gov. Walz, Lt. Gov. Flanagan announce financial institutions will provide additional mortgage-relief options to homeowners facing hardship due to COVID-19
</h1>
	<p class="lede">31 Minnesota credit unions and banks to extend some CARES Act mortgage-relief options to customers without a federally-backed mortgage</p>
    <p><strong>July  2, 2020 (SAINT PAUL)</strong>âMinnesota  Attorney General Keith Ellison, Governor Tim Walz, and Lieutenant Governor  Peggy Flanagan have announced a commitment by 31 Minnesota financial  institutions to provide mortgage-relief options to customers facing financial  hardship caused by COVID-19 for homeowners not covered by the CARES Act. </p>
    <p>Under  this framework, participating financial institutions have agreed to offer the  following relief options: </p>
    <ul class="LIDisc ">
      <li><strong>90-day       forbearance period for customers facing financial hardship caused by       COVID-19 </strong><br>
        Participating financial institutions will offer mortgage-payment       forbearances of up to 90 days to single- or multi-family mortgage       customers directly impacted by COVID-19. The framework went into effect       yesterday, July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2020, so qualifying customers can begin       applying for forbearance immediately.&nbsp; <br>
        &nbsp;</li>
      <li><strong>Customers       accessing forbearance will not be required to make a lump-sum payment at       the end of forbearance plan</strong><br>
        Participating financial institutions will not require single-family       customers who qualify for forbearance under this framework to make a       lump-sum payment at the end of the forbearance plan. Instead these       institutions will work with borrowers on repayment options, which may       include:
        <ul class="LIDisc noSpace">  
		<li>Allowing        customers to add the reduced or missed payments over the lifetime of        their loans; or </li>
        <li>Extending        the maturity of the loan to make up for the missed payments.<br>
          &nbsp;</li></ul></li>
        <li><strong>No late       fees or negative credit reporting for customers in a forbearance plan</strong><br>
        For single-family customers who are in an active forbearance plan under       this framework, the participating financial institutions will:
        <ul class="LIDisc noSpace">  
        <li>Freeze        all mortgage-related late fees for missed payments; and</li>
        <li>Not        report late or missed payments with credit reporting agencies.</li>
      </ul></li>
    </ul>
   
    <p>This  framework was negotiated by Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s office and Governor  Walz&rsquo;s office, and was supported by the Minnesota Department of Commerce and  Minnesota Housing. </p>
    <p>&ldquo;In the next few weeks, we may see a dramatic increase in the  number of foreclosures and evictions. I am very pleased to announce that these  banks and credit unions across Minnesota are working together to try to  mitigate the damage,&rdquo; <strong>Attorney General Ellison</strong> said. &ldquo;I thank each of  the participating institutions for stepping up to the plate to help Minnesotans  that are struggling because of COVID-19 and for recognizing that we are all  better off when every Minnesotan has stable housing.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;Minnesota families have been hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic,  and banks across the state have been working with their customers to help find  solutions,&rdquo;&nbsp;said <strong>Governor Walz</strong>. &ldquo;This initiative provides some added flexibility to Minnesotans  who need help affording their mortgage payments during this unprecedented  time.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>&ldquo;The COVID-19 crisis falls  hardest on Minnesotans who were already in crisis. For many low-income families  or Minnesotans who have lost jobs or sources of income, their housing stability  has been put at risk,&rdquo; said <strong>Lt. Governor Peggy Flanagan</strong>. &ldquo;Mortgage  relief is one way that we can provide some comfort and stability for those most  impacted. I am thrilled that we can work in partnership to offer this relief.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>Andy Cecere, President and CEO  of US Bancorp:</strong> <br>
  &ldquo;I want to thank Governor Walz,  Lt. Governor Flanagan, and Attorney General Ellison for their leadership in  these difficult times.&nbsp;At U.S. Bank, we are committed to serving our  community and we have aided thousands of customers who are facing financial pressure  due to the coronavirus.&nbsp;We remain committed to helping and encourage our  customers needing assistance to contact us digitally or over the phone to find  the best solution for their situation.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>Jeanne Crain, President and  CEO of Bremer Financial Corporation:</strong> <br>
  &ldquo;Bremer&rsquo;s purpose is to cultivate  thriving communities, and we have long recognized home stability as  foundational to strong communities. We have provided financial assistance to  our customers affected by COVID-19 over the past months, and we remain steadfast  in our promise to help. I appreciate the Attorney General&rsquo;s, the Governor&rsquo;s,  and the Lieutenant Governor&rsquo;s attention to this important issue. Bremer is  committed to supporting their efforts to help Minnesotans through these  challenging times.&rdquo; </p>
    <p><strong>Mark Cummins, President and  CEO of the Minnesota Credit Union Network:</strong> <br>
  &ldquo;As  not-for-profit financial cooperatives, it&rsquo;s part of our DNA to help consumers  through tough times. Since the COVID-19 pandemic reached Minnesota, the state&rsquo;s  credit unions have provided hundreds of thousands of their members relief from  mortgages, auto loans, credit-card payments, and business loans. Minnesota  Credit Unions are proud to participate in the Mortgage Forbearance Relief  Framework and are committed to meeting the financial needs of consumers through  this evolving situation.&rdquo; </p>
    <p>The  provisions of the framework apply to loans serviced by participating financial  institutions to the extent allowed by the applicable servicing framework with  the owner and/or insurer of the loan. They do not apply to loans serviced by  another bank and held in trust for which a bank may act as trustee. </p>
    <p>Since the  beginning of COVID-19, financial institutions across the state have been  working directly with their customers to help find relief  options.&nbsp;Customers who have been financially impacted by COVID-19 are  encouraged to reach out directly to their lender immediately to discuss what  solutions may be available.&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
    <p>This  framework is similar to frameworks reached in California, Michigan,  Pennsylvania, and other states. </p>
    <h2>FAQ on Minnesota&rsquo;s  Mortgage-Relief Framework with Financial Institutions</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>How do I apply for forbearance  offered by this framework?</strong> <br>
      You should first ensure that the  financial institution servicing your mortgage is participating in this  commitment. You can find your servicer&rsquo;s name on your mortgage statements or by  searching the <a href="https://www.mers-servicerid.org/sis/">Mortgage Electronic Registration  Systems (MERS)</a>. If  your mortgage servicer is participating in this framework, you should contact  and work with them directly to apply for relief offered under this framework. </p>
    <p><strong>How long will the forbearance  last?</strong> <br>
    Participating financial  institutions will offer forbearance up to 90-days. Qualifying customers can  apply for forbearance under this framework, starting on July&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2020  and ending on October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2020. </p>
    <p><strong>How long will the freeze on  mortgage-related late fees last?</strong> <br>
      For as long as you are in  forbearance under this framework, the participating institutions will not  charge you late fees for missed payments. </p>
    <p><strong>How long will the no negative  credit reporting last?</strong> <br>
      For as long as you are in  forbearance under this framework, the participating institutions will not  report late, missed, or skipped payments with credit-reporting agencies. </p>
    <p>Please be  aware that financial institutions may report a forbearance, which will not  impact your FICO score but may impact credit scores furnished by other  credit-score providers. It may also impact your ability to borrow in the  future. Contact your mortgage servicer directly to see if they will report the  forbearance to credit agencies. </p>
    <p><strong>Do I have to repay the monthly  mortgage payments that are suspended or reduced under this framework?</strong> <br>
      Yes. If you choose to take  advantage of the forbearance plan offered in this framework, you are still  responsible for repaying the mortgage payments or the balance of reduced  mortgage payments that you missed. </p>
    <p>However, participating financial  institutions will work with you to explore repayment options. You will not be  required to make a lump-sum payment of the payments you missed or reduced under  this framework. You will have other options for repayment, which may include: </p>
    <ul class="LIDisc noSpace">
      <li>Adding&nbsp; the reduced       or missed payments over the lifetime of your mortgage, which usually leads       to higher monthly mortgage payments; or</li>
      <li>Extending the maturity       of your mortgage to make up for the missed payments.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <p>We recommend you discuss which  repayment options best fits your needs when first applying for forbearance.  Contact your mortgage servicer to discuss your options. </p>
    <p><strong>What if forbearance is not the  best option for me?</strong> <br>
      If the  forbearance relief offered under this framework is not the best option for you,  we encourage you to contact your lender to explore other relief options.  Depending on your lending institution, they may be able to offer you other  forms of relief, including: </p>
    <ul class="LIDisc noSpace">
      <li>Only making monthly       interest payments on your mortgage.</li>
      <li>Interest rate reduction       on your mortgage.</li>
      <li>Extending the term of       your loan to reduce payments.</li>
      <li>Refinancing your loan       into a Fannie Mae loan.</li>

    <p><strong>What if my financial  institution/mortgage servicer didn&rsquo;t join this framework?</strong> <br>
      The Minnesota Attorney General&rsquo;s  office, the Governor&rsquo;s office, the Minnesota Department of Commerce, and  Minnesota Housing have also had productive conversations with other banks,  including independent community banks, about what options may be available to  their borrowers.&nbsp; Many of these entities are interested in working  one-on-one with their borrowers on a range of options for assistance, and  encourage borrowers impacted by COVID-19 to reach out to them. </p>
    <p>If you need relief and your  financial institution is not currently participating in this framework, we  strongly encourage you to contact them to request relief. </p>
    <p><strong>What If I continue facing  financial hardship due to COVID-19 after October 1, 2020?</strong> <br>
      If you continue having trouble  making your mortgage payments due to COVID-19 after October&nbsp;1,&nbsp;2020,  contact your lender as early as possible. </p>
    <p><strong>What if I need assistance  requesting relief?</strong> <br>
      The <a href="https://www.hocmn.org/">Minnesota  Homeownership Center</a> is an independent nonprofit that specializes in assisting homeowners with their  options. They can be reached at (651) 659-9336 and <a href="mailto:info@hocmn.org" target="_blank">info@hocmn.org</a>. Consumers are urged to reach out early, as  available options diminish once payments are missed. </p>
