<h1>Attorney General Ellison selects advocates, researchers, legislators to serve on Womenâs Economic Security Task Force </h1>
	<p class="lede">Names Lt. Gov. Flanagan and others as <span style="font-style: normal;">ad hoc</span> members</p>



	<p><strong>January 26, 2021 (SAINT PAUL)Â </strong>â Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison today announced that he has selected the 15 voting members of theÂ <a href="https://www.ag.state.mn.us/Office/Communications/2020/11/19_TaskForce.asp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Advisory Task Force on Expanding the Economic Security of Women</a>. They include advocates, researchers, Minnesotans with an interest in the topic, a legislator from each house and each party, and a representative from the Minnesota Department of Labor and Industry.Â Â </p>
	
	<p>Attorney General Ellison also announced that he has named severalÂ <em>ad hoc</em>Â members of the task force: Minnesota Lieutenant Governor Peggy Flanagan, Minnesota Department of Human Rights Commissioner Rebecca Lucero, Minnesota Solicitor General Liz Kramer, and Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s Chief of Staff Donna Cassutt. Ms. Cassutt will serve as a co-chair of the task force along with another co-chair to be selected by task force members.Â Â </p>
	
	<p>Attorney General Ellison has charged the task force with gathering in the best thinking in order to understand the multiple barriers women face in the economy and come up with a diverse set of strategies to create a more inclusive economy.Â Â </p>
	
	<p>&ldquo;Getting to the root of the causes for women&rsquo;s economic insecurity and comprehensive solutions for turning that it into security, equity, and opportunity requires a broad range of experience and perspective. I&rsquo;m grateful to the members who have stepped up to contribute, including Lt. Governor Flanagan, and to everyone who applied. We will need everyone&rsquo;s best thinking, effort, and good will to turn Minnesota into the most prosperous and economically secure state for women.&rdquo;Â </p>
	
	<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my honor to serve as anÂ <em>ad hoc</em>Â member of the Advisory Task Force on Expanding the Economic Security of Women,&rdquo; said Lieutenant Governor Flanagan. &ldquo;As an advocate for children and families, a daughter raised by a single mom, and a mom of a young girl myself, I have seen firsthand the way that women are the backbone of our families and our economy. Achieving economic security and parity for women lifts up all Minnesotans.&rdquo;Â </p>
	
	<p>The Task Force will hold its first monthly meeting on February 4, 2021 from 5:00â7:30 p.m. via Zoom. The task force will produce a report within nine months, before the start of the 2022 legislative session, and will continue its work for up to two years. All meetings, whether virtual or in-person, will be open to media and the public.Â Policy Research Associate Sadaf Rahmani of Attorney General Ellison&rsquo;s office will serve as the staff leadÂ for the task force.Â </p>
	
	<p>The members of the task force were chosen from among 93 people who applied through the Secretary of State&rsquo;sÂ <a href="https://commissionsandappointments.sos.state.mn.us/Agency/Details/284" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-auth="NotApplicable">Open Appointment</a>Â process.Â Â </p>

	<h2>State of women&rsquo;s economic security and scope of the task force</h2>
	
	<p>In Minnesota, women continue to face significant barriers to achieving their full potential in the economy.Â Â </p>
	
	<ul type="disc">
	  <li>Minnesota women on average make 79 cents for every dollar that men make.Â Â Â </li>
	  <li>The wage gap is even larger for Native and women of color. Latina, Native, and Black women earn 54, 54, and 61 cents, respectively, for every dollar that white men earn.Â Â Â </li>
	  <li>Women make up the majority of workers paid at or below the minimum wage.Â Â </li>
	  <li>Women are underrepresented in high-paying STEM jobs.Â Â Â </li>
	  <li>The shortage of affordable child care and the lack of widespread paid family leave further disadvantages women economically.Â </li>
    </ul>
	
	<p>Members of the Task Force will have three charges:Â Â </p>
	
	<ol>
	  <li>Identify the barriers thatÂ prevent gender equity in the workplace and limit women's equal participation in the economy, including: gendered-based pricing (the &ldquo;Pink Tax&rdquo;) in consumer goods and services, barriers that fall disproportionately on women of color and immigrant women, and the disproportionate economic impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on women;Â Â </li>
	  <li>Explore best practices to advance the economy security of women; andÂ Â </li>
	  <li>Develop a comprehensive set of recommendations that protect and support women's economic security in Minnesota.Â </li>
    </ol>
